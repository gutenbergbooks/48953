<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_REISSUE" id="PREFACE_TO_REISSUE"></a>PREFACE TO REISSUE</h2>

<p>It has quite recently been stated in an American
journal that Herr Dernburg&mdash;the German official
apologist to the United States&mdash;speaking of the
shelling of Hartlepool and Yorkshire watering-places,
was convinced that it would ‘bring home to
the English people a keen realization of the fact
that every serious attempt to invade England in the
past has been successful.’ Had Herr Dernburg
read any connected narrative of the invasions of
England we are of opinion that he would never
have made this statement, for it is obvious that
since the Norman conquest no successful invasion
has taken place without the active sympathy and
assistance of a great section of the population.</p>

<p>Both before and during the present war the
Germans have shown themselves so incapable of
reading correctly the habits of thought of the
British, of Americans, of Indians, of South Africans,
that one is scarcely surprised to find them ignorant
of the history of the British peoples also.</p>

<p>Let Herr Dernburg study the history of the
Cinque Ports, or of any of the seafaring towns of
South Devon and Cornwall, and he will find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
sporadic raids and bombardments were frequent
enough in mediæval, Tudor, and even later times;
but for any invasion that did not meet in some
degree with the approval of the country he will
search in vain after he has passed the landmark
of 1066. Even the Norman conquest was achieved
through the lack of that real national cohesion which
could not come to pass within such a brief period as
the interval between the last Danish invasion and
the death of Edward the Confessor.</p>

<p>Great Britain and Ireland in 1915 show a united
front to the invader, and the inevitable fate of any
force that has the temerity to set hostile feet on
British soil will be the same as that of General Tate
and his 1,400 men in the year 1797.</p>

<p>There is such a widespread lack of exact knowledge
on the subject of the invasions of England
that this new edition, at a popular price, of a volume
concerned with the whole of them, from Cæsar to
Napoleon, may help to clear a good many minds of
misconceptions.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Since the year 1794, when England seethed with
excitement through fear of a French Republican
invasion, no book has been produced dealing with
the invasions of England. The historical and
archæological work of the century that has passed
has shed so much light on dark and shadowy periods
of English history that the materials available for a
new work on the subject have become increasingly
extensive, and the authors have endeavoured to
take full advantage of all this new material. They
have, either together or separately, visited all the
important, and many of the minor, battle sites and
campaign areas mentioned in the text, and, as a
result of close study, they have in certain instances
arrived at conclusions at variance with those
generally accepted.</p>

<p>By careful topographical work, aided by every
shred of historical evidence available, the authors
venture to hope that they may have thrown a little
new light upon the great campaign in which the
Roman general Paulinus crushed the British struggle
for independence under Boudicca. They have also
devoted much time and thought to the elucidation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
of the problem of the identity of the heroes of the
Romano-British contests with the oncoming Teutons,
and to the areas of their chief military operations.
After much consideration and study of the
available authorities, they have arrived at the conclusion,
which they have not hesitated to express,
that Arthur, or Artorius, is a well-established
historical figure. One of the authors has, through
his family’s territorial connection with the Eastern
Border, had exceptional opportunities for becoming
familiar with the topography of the wild and intricate
region in which both are inclined to place the
fields of at least four, and perhaps six, of Arthur’s
twelve famous victories.</p>

<p>The field of Senlac has been examined by the
authors in the company of Sir Augustus Webster,
Bart., the present owner of Battle Abbey, himself a
practical soldier. The result of their investigations
has been to convince them that the line of the
Norman advance lay considerably to the east of
where it is generally placed, and that the great bulk
of Harold’s army was massed about the site of the
abbey itself. His right wing, being almost unassailable
owing to the protection given to it by the
marshy ground in its front, was probably very
weakly held. Relying on the contemporary evidence
of the Bayeux tapestry, and considering the circumstances
of Harold’s march, the authors are
inclined to discount any effective entrenchments or
palisading.</p>

<p>In regard to the strategy and tactics of Flodden,
a close study of contemporary documents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
authorities tends to emphasize certain features which
are often overlooked or ignored. First, the Scottish
army evidently changed its position twice to counteract
Surrey’s puzzling flanking movement. Second,
it can have had no proper service of scouts, and
was too cumbrous to manœuvre readily, circumstances
which left it at the mercy of its numerically
inferior antagonist. Third, it was never able to
form a complete line of battle owing to the slowness
of the right wing in coming into action. Fourth, so
far as appears from the letters of the English leaders,
there was no slackness on the part of the Scottish
Lord Chamberlain who commanded the left wing.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the relative strengths
of the English and Spanish fleets in 1588. The
authors’ opinions may be summarized as follows:
(1) The Spaniards had an undoubted superiority in
tonnage, but in strength of ships actually built for
war the English had the advantage. (2) The
English ships, being manned by a majority of sailors,
were infinitely better handled; and the galleons of
the Royal Navy were faster sailers than those of the
Spanish. (3) There is no real reason to think that
the Spaniards were outmatched in number and
power of guns, but the English gunnery, though
bad, was better and more rapid than that of their
antagonists. (4) The Spanish tactics, as compared
with that of the English, was antiquated, being
based on the formation of line abreast and a close
order, which hampered the manœuvring of individual
ships and impeded the use of broadsides.</p>

<p>The exigencies of space have compelled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
authors to pass briefly over the later period of
attempted invasions, and to concentrate attention
upon those attempts which actually succeeded so
far as to effect a landing upon English soil. An
exception has, however, been made in regard to
Napoleon’s project of 1804-5, which has been briefly
discussed. It was the last attempt of an ancient
enemy, France having been actively organizing
invasions of England in 1744 and again in 1759.
The latter project was ably planned by Choiseul and
Belleisle, and was at least as feasible as Napoleon’s
far more celebrated design; but it shared its fate of
hopeless failure owing to Britain’s supremacy on
the sea.</p>

<p>To Mr. Julian Corbett the authors are indebted
for his kindness in reading the proofs of the chapters
on the Armada period. The observations on
Napoleon’s project of invasion are based entirely
upon the works of Mr. Corbett and Colonel
Desbrière.</p>

<p>In writing on a subject of such permanently vital
interest to the British nation as the question of
invasion, it may be thought desirable that the
authors should express the conclusions to which
they have been led in the course of their researches.
They, however, prefer to merely direct the attention
of their readers to the fact that no successful
invasion of England has taken place since 1066
without the active sympathy and assistance of a
considerable section of the population. Prior to
that date Britain and England were not in any real
sense of the word single united communities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
The salient fact is that so long as England remained
strong at sea, and her strength was intelligently
and vigorously directed, she was able to beat
off every serious attempt against her. It is unnecessary
to insist here on the universally accepted
axiom that British national and imperial existence
rests on the maintenance of a supreme navy.</p>

<p>The maps have all been drawn by the authors for
the express purpose of illustrating their deductions,
and among the objects illustrated are several which
have never before, it is believed, been depicted in
any published work.</p>

<p>In the year 57 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Gaius Julius Cæsar, Roman
politician, statesman, and legislator, and already,
though he had only girt on the sword at forty-three
years of age, a famous soldier, was campaigning in
northern Gaul. The year before, a mere carpet
warrior, as his enemies would have men believe, he
had come up the Rhone with six legions of sturdy
swarthy Italian yeomen, and summarily put an end
to the great Helvetic migration, a migration perhaps
little less dangerous than that of the Cimbri and
‘Teutones,’ which his kinsman Marius had annihilated
at Aquæ Sextiæ and Vercellæ. Then, grimly
resolute, with reluctant officers, with the scented
young nobles who had followed him for a little
plunder and mild excitement foreboding disaster,
with even the stout legionaries&mdash;all save the men of
the immortal Xth&mdash;hanging back and half afraid,
he had turned on the Germans who were overrunning
Gaul, and hurled them in rout and ruin
across the Rhine. And&mdash;significant fact!&mdash;he
wintered not in the sunny Roman Province&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Provence which still proclaims to the world from a
hundred sites that Imperial Rome swayed her sceptre
there for twenty generations&mdash;not in the Italian
Gallia along the Po, but there, where he was, in the
very homeland of the Celts, which five hundred
years before had sent forth the hordes that had
wasted Italy and burned Rome. The Gauls, disunited,
faction-ridden, fickle, and suspicious of each
other, but proud, brave, and patriotic, began to take
alarm.</p>

<p>Whether Cæsar had intended from the first to
subjugate Gaul, or whether his horizon became
enlarged as his successes multiplied, are questions
that cannot be discussed here. But he certainly
seems to have shown his hand in 58 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> ‘Celtic’
and ‘Aquitanian’ Gaul remained passive, but in the
north, where the ‘Belgæ’ had had little to do with
Roman envoys and traders, much less with Roman
generals and legions, a confederacy was quickly
formed to oppose Cæsar. It was headed nominally
by Galba, King of the Suessiones, whose predecessor,
Divitiacus, had ruled an ephemeral dominion extending
over a large region of northern Gaul and parts
of Britain. So writes Cæsar in the second book, ‘De
Bello Gallico’; and thus, in a single terse sentence
of his perfect, unadorned Latin, Britannia is swept
by a roving searchlight of historical allusion.</p>

<p>Early next year Cæsar came up from Central
Gaul, now with a formidable force of eight legions,
with cavalry from Gaul and elsewhere, with
Numidian light troops, with archers from the East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
and slingers from the Baleares, with engineers and
siege artillery, to deal with the Belgians. The great
ill-cemented confederacy was shattered with slight
difficulty, but the fighting Nervii and other tribes,
which would not be daunted by a single defeat,
proved foes worthy of Cæsar’s steel, and were only
subdued after a desperate battle. In 57 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> all the
coast tribes from the Loire to the Rhine united
against Cæsar, and this time there is distinct reference
to regular intercourse between Gaul and Britain.
This confederacy was crushed, after hard and
harassing fighting, by a great naval victory off the
southern coast of Brittany. It had been supported
by British troops, and perhaps by British ships. At
any rate, it must have been plain to the great proconsul
that Britain was a factor that could not be
ignored in dealing with the Gallic problem.</p>

<p>On Cæsar’s staff at this time was a Gallic noble
named Commius, whom he had made king of the
Atrebates in Belgium. The most important fact
about him for our present purpose is that he had
connections with Britain. The Belgæ had indeed
far overflowed the limits of their Gallic territory;
it is possible that the entire south-east of Britain
from the Wash to the Somersetshire Avon, and
thence to Southampton Water, was occupied by
Belgic or Belgicized tribes. In a region roughly
corresponding to Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somerset,
there was a confederacy which preserved the
racial appellation of Belgæ. In Berks and Surrey
dwelt the Atrebates, evidently cognate with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Atrebates of Belgica; while the name of the great
and warlike Catuvellauni of the south-east Midlands
clearly points to a connection with the Catalauni of
the Marne. It is at least possible that the other
tribes of the south-east&mdash;the Cantii of Kent, the
Regni of Sussex, the wealthy Trinobantes of Essex
and Suffolk, and even the Iceni of Norfolk&mdash;were
of Belgic origin.</p>

<p>So much Cæsar may easily have learned from
Commius, or from hostages and prisoners. That
there was a close ethnic affinity between the tribes
on either side of the Channel a man of his intellectual
powers would not be slow to infer.
Whether he was fully acquainted with the economic
condition of the island is another matter. Pytheas
he may have, Polybius he must have, read, but
possibly the scepticism of the Achæan may have
prejudiced him against the Massiliot.</p>

<p>But be this as it may, when Cæsar began to
collect intelligence concerning Britain from Gallic
merchants, he was presented with information
largely untrustworthy, and some of which its
furnishers must have known to be false. The
statement that some of the British tribes practised
polyandry may or may not be true&mdash;the traders had
no obvious motive for deceiving Cæsar on such a
point; but they may themselves have depended
upon hearsay evidence. But otherwise they appear
to have done their best to misinform the proconsul,
with the obvious intention of inducing him to
abandon any idea of an invasion. Their motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
was clearly trade-jealousy. The whole British trade,
which appears to have been considerable, was in
their hands; they feared&mdash;naturally enough&mdash;Italian
competition. Then, too, they may have been
influenced by political motives. Britain was, as
things went, an admirable place of refuge for Gallic
organizers of revolt and for defeated leaders.</p>

<p>So, as far as one can see, Cæsar’s Gallic informants
told him as little as possible. On the one hand, they
seem to have done their best to overrate the
savage ferocity of the people; on the other, they
depreciated the wealth of the island. As they
could hardly assert that systematic cultivation of
cereals was unknown in the island, they explained
that this was the case only in the south-east; elsewhere
the people lived on milk and flesh, and,
having no knowledge of weaving, dressed in skins.
It is difficult to know how far Cæsar was deceived.
To some extent he certainly was, for he repeats the
false statements which were made to him. It may
perhaps seem curious that he did not verify them
while in Britain, but, of course, he had military
business in plenty to occupy him. His statement
about the iron bar currency is the strangest of all,
since it is certain that gold coins, struck in imitation
of Philip of Macedonia’s gold staters, had been in
circulation for not less than a century. It is just
possible that he means that iron bars took the place
of a copper coinage. It seems incredible that he
can have marched for more than a hundred miles
into Britain without meeting with some of the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
pieces of which so many survive, even if he had not
seen them in Gaul. In that part of Britain with
which he was personally acquainted he notes that
the population was dense, and dwellings, or groups
of dwellings, thickly dotted over the country-side.
But it is clear that in many respects his information
was very imperfect.</p>

<p>Upon Cæsar’s credibility as an historian volumes
have been written. To the impartial observer the
absolute frankness with which he admits the commission
of deeds which shock, or are supposed
to shock, the not over-sensitive consciences of
twentieth-century Europeans, is evidence in his
favour. In curt unadorned phrases, without a trace
of emotion, he tells of the enslaving of human
beings by scores of thousands, or of the pursuit by
cavalry of crowds of women and children. The
fact, of course, is that such occurrences were
common in war as it was waged in those days.
Cæsar herein was neither better nor worse than
hundreds of Roman or Greek generals. He was
better than many, for he never massacred his own
captive countrymen. It cannot be said that he
was worse than Skobelev, who at the taking of
Geok-Tepe in 1880 sent his cavalry in pursuit of a
flying horde that was largely composed of women
and children, just as Cæsar did at the destruction
of the Usipetes and Teucteri in 55 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> All this
is simply to lead up to the point that, while Cæsar
may, as is suggested by a good many critics, have
had unworthy motives for his expedition&mdash;such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
greed of slaves and plunder, or a desire to dazzle
the Roman populace&mdash;he gives a perfectly sound,
statesmanlike reason for his action. He says that
he had found that there were usually British contingents
in the ranks of the hostile Gauls, and that
he thought it advisable to cow the islanders. That
some of his officers expected, like professional
soldiers of every age, to enrich themselves is
certain; it is at least probable that Cæsar hoped
that the expedition might prove a paying investment.
But that he regarded it only as a plundering
raid there is no reason to think. Neither is there
any solid evidence to show that his position as a
Roman party-leader ever affected his military
operations. That when he left Rome to take up
his command he had a general idea of using his
army to attain supreme power is possible, even
probable. But once in Gaul the natural genius of
the man as soldier and statesman was devoted to
consolidating his country’s position there. His
action as regards Ariovistus shows that self-interest
was already subordinated to statesmanship which
must benefit Rome, and could only serve his own
ends incidentally.</p>

<p>In 55 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Cæsar was very active in Belgic Gaul.
He had swept the Teutonic hordes which had invaded
Gaul in the winter back into Germania with
frightful slaughter, not without treachery on his
part; he had bridged the Rhine, and displayed the
Eagles in a long raid on its eastern bank. This
had occupied him until late in the summer. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
as he says, it occurred to him that the short remainder
of the campaigning season might be
utilized for an expedition to Britain for the purpose
of collecting useful information&mdash;in short, for what
in modern military parlance would be termed a
reconnaissance in force. It does not appear that
he had anything further in mind. Later on he tells
us that he had no intention of making a long stay,
and he took only a few days’ provisions. Moreover,
the time was too short for collecting anything
like the number of ships required for the transportation
of several legions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the concentration of the Roman
Army of Gallia on the coast opposite Dover was an
event which could not but alarm the Britons, and,
while Cæsar was completing his arrangements, some
of their tribes sent over envoys. Presumably, the
idea was that by making a nominal submission the
invasion might be averted. Cæsar, however, quietly
observed that he would visit them at home in a few
days, and sent them back with, as his personal
emissary, Commius the Atrebatian. Commius had
instructions to use his influence to bring about a
general submission, but his British companions made
him prisoner immediately upon landing. Cæsar
meanwhile was collecting Gallic merchant-ships
for the transit, and had sent a trusted officer,
Gaius Volusenus, with a galley, to reconnoitre for
landing-places. The haste and incompleteness of
his preparations were so far of slight account, since,
though the Britons were determined on resistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
there was no time to form a confederacy. Caswallon
(Cassivellaunus), king of the Catuvellauni, the most
powerful chieftain of Britain, was endeavouring to
coerce the Trinobantes; the attack would be met
by the local tribal levies only.</p>

<p>Having gone so far, it may be advisable to say
a few words on the subject of the invading army
and the forces which were likely to oppose it. The
Roman Army of Gaul, though it had perhaps hardly
reached the pitch of excellence which it attained at
the outbreak of the Civil War, was, nevertheless, in
55 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, one of the finest that the world has ever
seen. There were eight legions of Italian troops,
and of these the two newest had seen three years’
hard service. Two had served four campaigns, and
the remaining four were the pith of the army. Their
numbers were VII., VIII., IX., and X. All of
them had served four years under Cæsar, had
learnt to idolize him and to follow him with perfect
confidence, and all were composed of war-hardened
veterans of many years’ experience&mdash;men to whom
the hardships of war were but matter for jests, and
a battle a mere incident of everyday life. Knowing
them as we do, thanks to the man whom they served
so well, we may fairly doubt whether any soldiers
of any age ever surpassed them. The Xth has
come down through the ages associated with,
perhaps, the noblest eulogy ever paid by any leader
to his soldiers. A great Roman army, not yet knowing
itself or its leader, was trembling at the thought of
meeting the dreaded warriors of Germany. Its fears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
came to Cæsar, and Cæsar made his immortal reply:
‘So be it! Since none else will follow, I will go
forward with the Xth Legion alone. It will not
forsake me!’ And the legion sent to thank its
leader for the honour of being allowed to die with
him. Never again did
Cæsar’s soldiers hang
back, but the Xth always
remained ‘Cæsars Own.’
But Cæsar was not Napoleon;
he never nursed or
favoured it as Napoleon
did the Old Guard.
When it forgot its discipline,
Cæsar punished
it like any other corps;
it shared equally in all
the trials of the Army
of Gallia. At its head
Cæsar took his stand on
the field of Pharsalus,
and to this day, when an
exalted standard of devotion
is sought, it is
enough to cite that of
Cæsar’s Xth Legion.</p>

<p>The Xth was undoubtedly the finest of the
legions, but the three other old corps were not
greatly inferior; and the younger divisions were
steadily improving, proud of themselves and of
their leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
The legion of Cæsar’s day was a division of six
thousand infantry at full strength, exclusive of
officers. It was divided into ten battalions (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cohortes</i>),
and each cohort into six companies (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">centuriæ</i>), each
of one hundred men, under a centurion (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">centurio</i>)
generally, so far as is known, promoted from the
ranks. Into the complicated question of the ranking
and promotion of these officers, there is no need
to enter here; it is sufficient to say that the senior
centurions were entitled to sit in councils of war,
and that the senior of all (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primi pili centurio</i> or
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primipilus</i>) often appears as playing a very distinguished
part. Attached to each legion were six
officers called tribunes, frequently young gentlemen
learning the art of war. Often, as might be
expected, they were rather a nuisance than otherwise;
but there were exceptions, notably C. Volusenus,
who has just been mentioned. Probably
the trouble was to induce them to take their
military position seriously. Cæsar’s higher executive
officers were his ten lieutenant-generals (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">legati</i>),
of whom we frequently meet several in command of
one, two, or more legions. The best was Titus
Labienus, strangely enough the only one who sided
against his general in the Civil War. He was a
greedy, cruel, and unprincipled man, but beyond
doubt a great general; Cæsar repeatedly gives him
unstinted praise. Of the others, probably the most
promising was the young P. Licinius Crassus, who
was to perish on his father’s ill-starred expedition
against the Parthians; but several were men of real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
distinction. Among them may be mentioned M.
Antonius, afterwards the rival of Augustus; Decimus
Junius Brutus, the hero of the naval victory
over the Veneti; C. Fabius Maximus; Q. Tullius
Cicero, brother of the more famous Marcus, but
himself a soldier of great merit; and C. Trebonius.
Cæsar’s chief administrative officer was his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quæstor</i>
(quartermaster-general), M. Licinius Crassus.</p>

<p>The legionary soldier’s equipment was perhaps
unsurpassed in those ages for lightness and completeness.
His clothes consisted of a sleeveless
woollen shirt, drawers reaching to just below the
knee, and over them a tunic. On his feet he wore
half-boots with light uppers, and heavy soles studded
with nails. His defensive arms consisted of a corselet
of long overlapping strips of steel, a helmet with
a low crest, and a semi-cylindrical shield some
4 feet long, made of wood covered with ox-hide,
with a rim and central boss of iron, combining the
minimum of weight with the maximum of protection.
For purposes of offence the soldier bore two of the
famous <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pila</i>, and a short, sharp-pointed, double-edged
sword. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pilum</i> was a long, heavy
javelin, which could also be used as a pike. It
consisted of a thick wooden shaft some 4 feet long,
with a slender iron rod, terminating in a small lancehead,
projecting for about 3 feet more. It appears
to have had a range, when in practised hands, of
some 50 yards. Rank after rank delivered volleys
of these heavy missiles, and when the well-drilled
swordsmen charged, they usually found the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
severely shaken. Against mounted troops bearing
the bow the legion, intended for close fighting, was,
of course, at a great disadvantage, but for many
centuries it was the lord of Mediterranean battlefields.</p>

<p>The defects of the legion had not escaped the
notice of Roman military organizers, and it was
already accompanied by auxiliary cohorts of light
troops. In Cæsar’s army they were not very
numerous as compared with the legionaries&mdash;perhaps
about as one to six. Northern Africa
supplied excellent skirmishers&mdash;its light cavalry
was world-renowned, but Cæsar does not appear
to have had any of it in Gaul. Crete supplied him
with archers, and Balearic slingers served with
him as with Hannibal. Later the proportion of
auxiliaries is found steadily on the increase. Under
the Empire there were at least as many auxiliaries
as legionaries. Cæsar, however, depended mainly on
his legions. For cavalry he relied chiefly on friendly
Gallic tribes, though it is probable that he had a
small body of Italian or Italian-Gallic horse. From
52 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> onward he had a brigade of German cavalry
in his pay.</p>

<p>The engineering department of the Roman army
has never been equalled. There was a corps of
engineers, but entrenching was part of the private
soldier’s training. No body of troops ever halted
for the night without surrounding themselves with
a rampart and ditch. The result of constant experience
of spade-work was that Roman troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
frequently accomplished feats of engineering that
seem almost miraculous. The work that in modern
armies falls upon the engineers was in that of Rome
chiefly done by the infantry privates. Cæsar in his
campaigns made good use of the siege artillery of
the period, and his march was generally accompanied
by a train of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">balistæ</i> (gigantic crossbows), <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">catapultæ</i>,
and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">scorpiones</i>.</p>

<p>Every legion had a baggage train, of course, and
probably every privates’ mess had at least one slave
for menial service; but the legionary bore a great
part of his baggage himself, and it is a marvel how
he contrived to march&mdash;as we know he did&mdash;anything
from fifteen to twenty-five miles a day under
his burdens. Besides arms, armour, and cloak, he
carried grain or flour to last for a fortnight, a spade,
a saw, a basket, several pales wherewith to crown
the camp rampart, as well as his share of the mess
service and other matters.</p>

<p>The standard of the legion was now always
the famous Eagle, which had been introduced or
generally established by Marius. The Eagle-bearer
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aquilifer</i>) was always a soldier chosen for good
conduct and gallantry. He wore the skin of a wild
beast over his helmet as the sign of his honourable
position. With one of these gallant men we shall
soon make acquaintance.</p>

<p class="notbold">His weapons and shield drawn from originals in the British Museum.</p></div></div>

<p>Against this magnificent military machine the
Britons had little but a mass of disorderly and
ill-armed levies, formidable in numbers, individual
courage and physical strength, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
cohesion. Most of them fought on foot, and few
can have possessed body-armour; they were protected
only by helmet and shield, perhaps not
always the former. They were armed with badly-tempered
iron swords and spears, and in battle
made free use of missiles of all kinds&mdash;chiefly, it
would seem, darts and stones. Of cavalry there
were few; the British horses were too small for
riding. The bulk of the wealthier warriors fought
from timber cars. This chariotry was evidently a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
formidable force, and gave the Romans serious
trouble. The small active horses took the cars
along at a great rate, and the picked warriors who
manned them&mdash;strong, active, and brave, as well as
skilled with their weapons&mdash;were capable of being
extremely dangerous. The cars certainly were not
armed with scythes on their axles; their effectiveness
lay chiefly in their mobility and the skill with
which they were manœuvred, to which Cæsar bears
emphatic testimony. In the nobles who went into
battle on them the pomp and circumstance of
British war was seen at its best. With their
brightly-dyed garments, their tall helmets surmounted
by bronze ornaments or waving plumes,
their body-armour and shields bright with enamel
and gilding, and displaying all the wonderful intricacies
of Celtic spiral metal-work, their beautifully
wrought scabbards and sword-hilts, their golden
bracelets and collars, the British chiefs must have
been splendid figures.</p>

<p>Volusenus returned after a cruise of five days.
He had not ventured to land, but brought information
of value as to landing-places. Some ninety-eight
vessels were now collected in the country of
the Morini, most of them probably at the modern
Boulogne, and on eighty of them Cæsar embarked
his two best legions, the VIIth and the Xth, with
no doubt, some light troops&mdash;perhaps ten thousand
men in all. On board the other eighteen, which
lay in a neighbouring harbour, were to go about
five hundred cavalry. The order reached them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
late, and there was further delay in carrying it
out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, probably on the evening of August 25,
the main body of the transports, escorted by some
warships, set sail, and early next morning was off
Dover. The war-galleys were in front, the heavy
transports slowly coming up from the rear. Volusenus
had, no doubt, pointed out Dover Harbour as
the most usual place for landing, but the Britons
were in force to oppose the disembarkation. The
beach was lined with chariots, the slopes of Castle
Hill and the Western Heights were swarming
with foot-levies; and in a place where, as Cæsar
says, darts could be rained upon the beach from
the cliffs a landing would be extremely dangerous.
From Volusenus he knew that only six or
seven miles northward there was the open shelving
beach of Deal. At noon the whole fleet had
assembled, and Cæsar gave the order to weigh
and move northward.</p>

<p>The Britons at once followed suit. Horse, foot,
and chariots faced to their left, climbed over Castle
Hill, and streamed down its farther slope. The
infantry were soon left behind; the charioteers
and horsemen, however, outpaced the heavily-laden
Roman ships, and galloped down to the shore in time
to oppose the landing. The ships, heavy-draft Gallic
merchantmen, grounded some way out, and the
troops, smitten by showers of missiles, and seeing
the gallant show on the beach, hesitated to jump
with arms and armour into several feet of water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Cæsar ordered the war-galleys, manned by the
archers and slingers, to row forward and engage the
Britons. This was done, but the only effect was to
make them withdraw a little way; they still stood
threatening to charge. A lead was necessary, and
it was given by the standard-bearer of the Xth, who
sprang into the surges and led the way, bearing the
Eagle of Rome against the enemy. ‘Forward,
comrades!’ he shouted, ‘unless you would betray
the Eagle! I will do my duty to Rome and Cæsar!’
With a cheer every man on his ship followed. All
down the line men sprang recklessly overboard, and
singly and in groups began to wade up the shingly
beach; and all along the shore, in gallant response,
the Britons drove their chariots forward to the attack.
There was a furious struggle among the breakers,
and for some time the men of Kent held the strand;
but when the steady Roman veterans began to close
up into regular bodies, with boats full of archers
covering their flanks, the Britons gave way. The
Romans completed their landing, and laid out and
fortified a camp.</p>

<p>Next day the Britons sent envoys to Cæsar.
They brought with them Commius, whom they now
released, and offered submission. Cæsar was, no
doubt, highly pleased. He exacted hostages. Some
were brought during the next two days; others
were to follow.</p>

<div id="ip_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>A ROMAN TRIREME OFF DOVER.</p>

<p class="notbold">Reconstructed from Roman wall-paintings and sculptures of the first and second centuries of the Christian era.</p></div></div>

<p>On the morning of the 30th, however, a north-easter
came roaring down Dover Strait. Cæsar’s
cavalry transports, on their way at last, were swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
back and scattered into various harbours; the main
fleet was seriously damaged. Twelve vessels were
destroyed; many others so shattered as to need
extensive repairs. The troops, knowing that they
had only a few days’ food in hand, were depressed,
as Cæsar himself admits. If we needed any proof
that nothing but a reconnaissance had been intended
we have it here; it is evident that the force had not
even the usual fortnight’s grain.</p>

<p>Cæsar set the men to work on the necessary
repairs, but the Britons were encouraged by the
disaster to renew hostilities. Their chariotry and
horsemen caught the VIIth Legion while it was
foraging, and would have undoubtedly defeated it
had not Cæsar come up just in time with two
cohorts of the Xth. Several days of heavy rain
followed, but the spirits of the Kentishmen were
high. On the first fine day they moved up against
the camp, and when Cæsar’s legions formed line
outside they attacked them furiously. They were
of course driven back, and fled in disorder, and
Commius, with thirty mounted retainers and officers,
was able to pursue and cut up some of the stragglers.</p>

<p>The weather was now fine; Cæsar had no intention
of being again stormbound. He could now
be sure of a quiet embarkation; but while he was
making his preparations, Kentish envoys again
appeared. He ordered them to send twice as many
hostages as before, but this time to Gaul, as he was
returning that night. The passage was effected
without trouble; but once they saw their enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
clear of their coast, the men of Kent troubled no
more about hostages. Two clans alone sent their
quota. Probably the Britons argued that Cæsar’s
departure was a confession of defeat, and as a
number of modern writers have endeavoured to
maintain the same, we cannot blame them. Victories
have been claimed in modern times on no better
grounds than that a reconnaissance has been driven
in. In sober military terms the situation was simply
this: Cæsar had made a reconnaissance in force in
Britain. Owing to various accidents and mistakes,
he had been obliged to make a longer stay than he
had intended. He had obtained some knowledge
of the kind of resistance that he was likely to experience,
and his troops had held their own in such
fighting as had taken place.</p>

<p>Cæsar, on returning to the Continent, went on as
usual to the ‘Province’ and Cisalpina, but left his
legions on the coast, with orders to build as many
ships as possible specially designed for disembarkation
work, and also fitted with oars. He quietly
tells us that during the winter the troops built no
less than six hundred, as well as twenty-eight war-galleys!
The magnitude of the task and the speed
with which it was accomplished are alike amazing,
but the history of the Army of Gaul is full of such
feats.</p>

<p>The place of concentration for the fleet was
‘Portus Itius,’ about thirty (Roman) miles from
Britain. The latest and best authority on Cæsar
appears to think that this must be the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Wissant, four miles east of Cape Gris Nez. In all
some 800 warships and transports were assembled
there by the beginning of July, 54 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The expeditionary
force consisted of five legions, 2,000
cavalry, chiefly Gauls, and some thousands of light
troops&mdash;perhaps 30,000 men in all. Cæsar took
with him to Britain several Gallic chiefs as a measure
of precaution. Labienus was left in charge of Portus
Itius with three legions, some auxiliaries, and 2,000
cavalry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Britain, Caswallon of the Catuvellauni
was striving hard to form a defensive
confederacy. But the Trinobantes hung back, and
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">moribus majorum</i> Caswallon tried to coerce them.
He slew their king, but the only result was that
the dead chief’s son, Mandubracius, fled to Cæsar
for protection, thus furnishing him with a very
pretty <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">casus belli</i>. Caswallon was left to face the
Romans with the Trinobantes still hostile&mdash;almost
at his door.</p>

<p>Cæsar landed near Sandwich, this time unmolested.
The vast size of his fleet precluded all
idea on the part of the Kentishmen of opposing
the landing. Caswallon was collecting his levies,
and was still far behind. Cæsar landed his force,
fortified a strong camp, in which he stored his
reserve supplies, and told off ten cohorts (<i>i.e.</i>,
probably two from each legion), and 300 cavalry
as its garrison, under an officer named Quintus
Atrius.</p>

<p>During the day information was brought in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the Kentish levies were entrenched in a defensive
position about twelve (Roman) miles inland. Cæsar,
anxious to strike a heavy blow at the local resistance,
marched off to attack them before dawn
next day. The British position was probably on
the Stour, near Thanington, where there are traces
of ancient entrenchments.</p>

<p>In any case, whether the men of Kent were at
the Little Stour, as has been thought, or the Great
Stour by Canterbury, their position was stormed
without difficulty. From Cæsar’s description it
appears that their chariotry and cavalry were thrown
forward, and harassed the Roman columns as they
moved towards the main position. They were, however,
pushed back or aside, and the VIIth Legion,
forming the dense shield-covered column of attack,
which the Romans aptly termed the tortoise (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">testudo</i>),
carried the entrenchments with slight loss.
The defenders fell back into the woods. There
was no pursuit.</p>

<p>Next day, just as Cæsar was feeling his way
forward with cavalry, a message of disaster came
from Atrius. In the night there had been a heavy
gale, and great damage had been inflicted on the
fleet. Cæsar’s fighting eagerness, and consequent
neglect to profit by last years lesson, nearly led to a
grave disaster. As it was, he was obliged to move
back to the coast and keep the whole army hard at
work for ten days hauling the fleet up the beach
beyond high-water mark, and protecting it with
embankments. Forty vessels were so shattered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
to be incapable of repair. Many of the rest were
seriously damaged. Labienus was ordered to send
across a detachment of artificers chosen from his
legions to assist in repairing them. Cæsar’s trust
in his good fortune had carried him too far.</p>

<p>The result was that Caswallon was able to reach
the front with his Midland levies, and rally the
Kentishmen. Cæsar, on his part, sent the exile
Mandubracius to the Trinobantes to raise trouble
in his adversary’s rear; and, having as far as possible
put his ships in safety and seen repairs well under
way, again took the road inland. His objective,
as he clearly indicates, was the nearest point of
passage on the Lower Thames. Once across the
river, he would be in the territory of the Catuvellauni,
and able to communicate with the Trinobantes.</p>

<p>He was to have no easy task. Caswallon was a
foeman worthy of Cæsar’s steel. He seems to have
fully realized that the British foot-levies were useless
against the legions except at a great advantage.
He declined to defend the line of the Stour, but
as soon as it was across the stream, the Roman
column found itself engaged in a running fight, in
which the heavily armed and burdened legionaries
were at a disadvantage. The next day Caswallon
set upon the Romans as they were laying out their
camp, drove in the outposts, killing the tribune in
command, burst through the intervals of the supporting
cohorts, and drew off with little loss, after
causing great confusion. This half success, however,
led to a severe defeat. Probably the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
could not restrain his eager and undisciplined foot-levies.
On the morrow Cæsar sent out all his
cavalry and three legions under Trebonius to
forage. The force was attacked by the British
mounted arms, but the foot-levies got out of hand
and charged the legions while they were still in
close order. They were repulsed with much bloodshed,
of course, and the Roman cavalry, closely
supported by infantry, was able to cut them up
badly before they could regain the woods.</p>

<p>Caswallon, unshaken, fell back on his guerrilla
tactics. His chariotry and cavalry were intact.
Cæsar says that they were about four thousand, a
moderate estimate which shows it to be near the
truth. With them he faced his great antagonist,
while the southern levies took refuge in the Weald,
and those of the Catuvellauni went back to entrench
the fords of the Thames. From the neighbourhood
of Canterbury to that of London the Romans
advanced slowly, probably along the line of the
later Watling Street, while Caswallon moved
parallel to them in the woods, hung about the
line of march, and harassed it incessantly. The
Gallic horsemen never dared to move far from the
infantry columns. Caswallon was ever watchful.
But it was not guerrilla warfare, however skilful and
gallant, that could stay the march of Cæsar’s legions.
The advance was slow and difficult, but still it
continued steadily until the Thames was reached.
Caswallon retreated across it, and the Romans
followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Where the British leader was stationed it is hard
to say. The course of the Thames, meandering
among marshes, must have varied much from what
it is to-day, and, having no embankments, it was
probably much shallower. Cæsar may have crossed
near Brentford or Halliford; there are said to be
the remains of a stockade in the bed of the river
opposite the former place. At any rate, Cæsar
gives the impression that the ford was well known.
Its northern end was guarded by entrenchments,
and the passage itself was obstructed by stakes.
The position was a formidable one, yet it was
carried with unexpected ease. The Roman cavalry
led the way into the Thames, the infantry followed,
with the water at their necks, passed the stakes&mdash;how
we do not know&mdash;carried the stockade, and
drove the Britons off towards the north.</p>

<p class="notbold">The probable line of advance on Verulam is indicated by the broken line.</p></div></div>

<p>Cæsar, having passed the Thames, halted for a
time to receive hostages and supplies from the
neighbouring Trinobantes. Caswallon fell back on
his tribal stronghold (almost certainly Verulam),
and sent orders to the four sub-kings of Kent to
attack Cæsar’s base-camp, and so draw him back
from the Thames. It was the last fine stroke of
Caswallon’s admirable strategy, but fate was against
him. Atrius marched boldly out to attack the men
of Kent, defeated and scattered them with great
loss, capturing a prominent chief named Lugotorix.
Cæsar, having rested his men in the Trinobantian
territory near London, advanced upon Verulam.
He describes it as a great earthwork among woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and marshes. It was captured by a simultaneous
attack on two fronts. The British loss was heavy,
and included thousands of captives, besides vast
quantities of supplies. Verulam had evidently been
the place of refuge of a great part of the tribe.</p>

<p>Caswallon had done his best and had failed.
Through Commius, who was with the Romans, he
made overtures, and Cæsar was not unready to
accept them. Reports were coming in from Labienus
of alarming unrest among the Gauls, which was soon
to blaze out into a great national uprising. It was
clearly time to go. Cæsar was justified in supposing
that he had done enough to convince the Britons
that interference in Gallic affairs would, for the
future, be dangerous. His terms of peace were,
therefore, moderate enough. Caswallon was to
keep the peace with Mandubracius, pay a yearly
tribute to Rome, and, of course, give hostages for
the observance of the conditions. They were accepted,
and, with his hostages and captives, Cæsar
returned to the coast. Two trips were necessary
owing to the large number of prisoners to be transported.
Apart from them (and being only fit for
rough field and house work, they would hardly fetch
a high price) there appears to have been little spoil
of value, much to the disappointment of many
greedy officers. Cicero quaintly voices this discontent
in his letters. We hear, however, that
Cæsar dedicated to Venus a cuirass ornamented
with British pearls, so that possibly some were
lucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
All this probably weighed little with Cæsar beside
the fact that he was not likely to have Britain on
his rear during the Gallic disturbances. If Caswallon,
a man, as far as we can see, of remarkable
ability for war, had been able to intervene in the
great struggle with Vercingetorix two years later,
the consequences might have been very serious.
As it was, we hear no more of British aid given
to the Gauls, and Cæsar was content. Whether
the tribute was paid we do not know; possibly it
was so long as Cæsar was in Gaul. When the civil
war broke out, it probably lapsed; but the general
political results of the expedition appear from Cæsar’s
point of view to have been satisfactory.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CLAUDIAN INVASION AND THE ROMAN
CONQUEST</span></h2>

<p>Of the history of Britain during the century
succeeding the Cæsarian expeditions we have some
fairly satisfactory glimpses. The terror of Cæsar
was sufficient, on the one hand, to prevent the
British chiefs from interfering in Gallic affairs. It
also appears to have deterred Caswallon from again
attacking the philo-Roman Trinobantes, for
numismatic evidence shows that they were independent
at a much later epoch. But it does seem
certain that it helped forward British unity, since
we find a tendency to form groups or ‘empires’
that certainly included more than one tribe. One
of these was founded by Commius the Atrebatian.
He had taken sides with his countrymen against
Cæsar in the last great Gallic uprising, and, after
some remarkable adventures, had escaped to his
kinsmen in Britain. By then he appears to have
been acknowledged as king; at any rate, coins have
been found bearing his name in what is known to
have been the territory of the Atrebates. He and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
his sons extended their rule over the Cantii, the
Regni of Sussex, and over some at least of the
small clans known as Belgæ.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, north of the Thames, the Catuvellauni
was recovering from the effects of Cæsar’s invasion.
It is at least possible that the discovery of rich gold-mines
had something to do with their undoubtedly
rapid rise in power. At any rate, Tasciovan, very
probably the successor of Caswallon, coined most
extensively in gold, silver, and bronze, and his
widely-diffused coins show strong traces of Roman
influence. His capital was certainly Verulam (St.
Albans), since on most of his coins the Latinized
name of the place figures. The Cantii and Trinobantes,
however, still appear to have been the most
civilized peoples of Britain. Tasciovan perhaps
initiated a policy of aggression upon the Commian
kingdom, and his son, Cunobelin, extended his
sway over the entire south-east and south. The
Iceni (Norfolk) and the Damnonii (Somerset,
Devon, Cornwall) appear to have kept their independence,
but may have paid tribute; and the
Silures of South Wales were probably in Cunobelin’s
sphere of influence. His capital seems to have been
not his father’s Verulam, but the Trinobantian
Camulodunum (Colchester).</p>

<p>The result of Cunobelin’s supremacy was that
tribal wars ceased, and civilization and industry
made great strides. Probably Cunobelin took care
to pay polite attentions to Augustus and Tiberius&mdash;Strabo
says as much&mdash;and though the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Emperor sheltered fugitive Commian and Trinobantian
princes, there was no intervention in British
affairs. Trade flourished. Strabo says that Britain
exported gold, silver, and iron, as well as pelts,
slaves, hounds, corn, and cattle. The last two items
seem dubious, yet the sceptical Strabo is hardly
likely to have noted them without good reason.
Roman traders and travellers passed freely to and
fro, and the southern regions became well known.
It is at this period more than at any other that we
must look for the rise of a commercial settlement at
London. One of Cunobelin’s sons, Adminius, rebelled
against him in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 39, and fled to the
Emperor Caligula. The latter’s military demonstration
near Gessoriacum (Boulogne) has been
noted (and probably misunderstood) by Suetonius.
In <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 41 Caligula was assassinated, and succeeded
by Claudius I., and in the same year Cunobelin died.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the flight of
Adminius was only one of the family troubles that
vexed the last years of the old ‘Rex Brittonum.’
His death was followed by intestine war; but after
a short struggle, two sons, Togodubn and Caradoc
(Caratacus), gained the ascendancy, and ruled
jointly over their fathers realm. They doubtless
had much to do in reconquering rebellious vassals,
and, to add to their difficulties, one of their dispossessed
brothers (or half-brothers) fled to Claudius.
Togodubn and Caradoc thereupon very unwisely
demanded his surrender. The result was the
Roman Conquest.</p>

<p>CLAUDIUS I. (10 B.C.&ndash;A.D. 54).</p>

<p class="hang">The fifth of the Twelve Cæsars. He is best remembered as the Emperor who initiated the
conquest of Britain. He was capable, learned, kindly, and well-meaning, but unfortunately weak
and self-indulgent.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Claudius I. was perhaps tempted into the invasion
by his dislike of the cruel rites of Druidism,
which, now that Gaul was Roman, had its main
stronghold in British Mona. But Roman capitalists
had for years been acquiring interests in the island;
when the occupation was an accomplished fact, they
settled down to bleed it in true usurers’ fashion,
with disastrous results. It is probable that the
formation of something like a British Empire close
to Gaul, where the old times were not forgotten,
and where a great revolt did actually break out a
generation later, seemed an alarming phenomenon.
Doubtless also there were plenty of ambitious
soldiers and politicians anxious to prove to the
sensible and kindly, but weak, old Emperor that the
honour of Rome could not brook the undiplomatically
blunt requests of the British kings. Probably
all these influences were brought to bear upon
Claudius, and induced him to undertake a conquest
which in the end contributed materially to the
weakening of Roman power.</p>

<p>For the invasion Claudius concentrated four
legions, with auxiliaries and cavalry, in Gaul. This
meant 24,000 legionaries, supposing the cohorts to
be at full strength, with, as is probable, as many
auxiliaries. Taking the cavalry into consideration,
and making a deduction of 20 per cent. for absentees,
we can hardly reckon the force at less than 40,000
effectives; it may have been even stronger. The
commander was Aulus Plautius, a veteran who had
grown grey in war, and who, to judge from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
record, was singularly fitted for his post. Claudius
himself was on the way from Rome to join his army
with the Prætorian Guard.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes the Roman army was
still the army of Marius and Cæsar, but the proportion
of auxiliaries and cavalry was much greater.
Of the legions three came from the Army of the
Rhine: II., ‘Augusta’; XIV., ‘Gemina Martia’;
and XX., ‘Valeria Victrix.’ From the Army of
Pannonia, or the Upper Danube, came Legio IX.,
‘Hispana.’ The XIVth was to win the proud
title of ‘Conqueror of Britain’ during its stay of
twenty-five years. ‘Valeria Victrix’ remained for
more than three centuries, and the IInd did not
leave until 407.</p>

<p>The legions had now become so fixed in their
frontier cantonments that to move them bodily to
other regions was a delicate business. The new
Army of Britain grumbled, and seemed about to
mutiny. Its temper was not improved by the fact
that the Imperial commissioner appointed to inquire
into their grievances was the Emperor's treasurer,
Narcissus, a Greek civilian! One can almost hear
the Roman ‘Tommies’ asking, with much profanity,
why their dignity should be thus insulted,
and they expressed their contempt for the unmentionable
civilian by a riotous demonstration.
The old General, however, whom they respected,
soon recalled them to their duty. The affair had
important results, for the British kings were induced
by the news to believe that the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
would not sail, and so were unprepared when it
suddenly appeared in Kent.</p>

<p>The landing-place this time was probably Rutupiæ
(Richborough, near Sandwich), which for some
centuries to come was to be the usual starting-point
for the Continent. The men of Kent were too
unprepared to attempt to oppose the landing, but
they harassed the flanks of the army as it marched
for the Thames along the old, old track that Cæsar
had traversed a century before. This time the
British guerrilla tactics had slight effect; there was
ample cavalry to feel ahead, and ample light infantry
to guard the flanks. We hear no more of the stunning
and disordering surges of chariotry among the
Roman battalions&mdash;indeed, there is some reason to
believe that, with the introduction and breeding of
larger horses fit for riding, it was already in a state
of decline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Togodubn and Caradoc had crossed
the Thames, and were prepared to oppose the
Roman advance at the Medway, probably near
Rochester. The position was a strong one, with
the broad river and expanses of mud flat and marsh
in its front. Plautius, however, forced the passage
by a wide turning movement up the river under his
able legatus, T. Flavius Vespasianus, while a large
body of Batavian and North Gallic auxiliaries,
accustomed to amphibious operations, with the
greatest daring swam the river on the right. The
Britons were thus forced to abandon the river-bank,
but they fell back on the high ground towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Cobham and Shorne and stood firm. Next day
a great battle was fought. The Britons made a
fine resistance, and nearly captured the legatus
Hosidius Geta; but were at last defeated, and
retreated to the Thames. One could wish that
we had some better authority than Dion Cassius,
who wrote more than a hundred and fifty years
later, and is so confused and rhetorical that we read
him with deep distrust. We long for even the unmilitary
and epigrammatic Tacitus, but his books
relating to the early years of Claudius are lost.</p>

<p>Dion says, in brief, that the Britons crossed the
Thames near where it enters the sea. They did
so easily ‘because they knew the firm ground ...
and the easy passages, ... but the Romans following
them came to grief at this spot.’ We can
hardly imagine the Thames as fordable anywhere
below London, and the probable meaning of the
passage is that the Britons traversed the marshes
by well-known tracks, and then crossed the river
in boats or on rafts.</p>

<p>Now comes the most curious part; and, if Dion
could be relied upon, we have an invaluable reference
to the earliest London Bridge. The Celts, he says,
again swam the river, and other troops forced a
bridge a little way upstream. We can hardly
imagine a bridge existing below London, and if it
stood anywhere, it would certainly be at the one
place clearly marked out by Nature for the passage
across the river of the road from the south-east to
Verulam. London was such a remarkable road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
centre in Roman times that we cannot easily believe
that it was not so long before, and the construction
of a pile bridge was certainly not beyond the
resources of a powerful ruler like Cunobelin, who
had, without any doubt, skilled foreigners at his
disposal, besides abundance of unskilled labour.
Moreover, it explains satisfactorily the importance
of London, which Tacitus describes as a great
trading centre only eighteen years later.</p>

<p>Whatever his authorities, Dion’s account of the
operations, studied with the aid of the map, is
logical and clear. The Britons are driven back
from the Medway, and retreat to the estuary of
the Thames across dangerous marshes&mdash;that is, we
can hardly doubt that Vespasian’s turning movement
cut their line of retreat on London, and they were
forced to fall back northward by Higham into Cliffe
Marshes. The Roman pursuit was checked by the
difficulties of the ground, but Plautius was between
the Britons and London. He therefore marched
for the bridge. The Britons, hurrying from Tilbury
Marshes, reached London too late to destroy the
bridge or occupy it with more than a fraction of
their forces, if indeed at all. The bold action of
the Batavians, who accomplished a more difficult
feat than the swimming of the Medway, coupled
with the seizure of the bridge, forced the Britons
to abandon the defence of the Thames.</p>

<p>Togodubn had been slain in the course of the
campaign, but Caradoc was alive and undismayed.
He retreated towards Camulodunum, not upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
ancestral capital of Verulam. Clearly, Camulodunum
was of greater importance. Meanwhile
Claudius had landed with the Imperial Guards and
was coming up. Dion says that the fighting had
been so fierce that the reinforcements which he
brought were very necessary. This may be a
flight of rhetoric, but it is evident that the resistance
was stubborn. Having effected a junction
with his general, Claudius advanced on Camulodunum.
Caradoc stood to fight somewhere on
the road&mdash;perhaps at the Blackwater&mdash;and was
defeated finally and utterly. Camulodunum was
taken, the empire broke up or submitted, and the
king, with his family and a remnant of his army,
fled away across Britain into the country of the
Silures (South Wales). Claudius himself only
waited to enter Camulodunum and to declare it
the capital of the Roman Province of Britannia,
and then returned to Gaul.</p>

<p>The heart of the Catuvellaunian dominion was
now occupied with little difficulty. The Iceni and
Regni sent in their submission; but Caradoc with
the Silures was preparing for a last desperate stand
for freedom, if not for empire; and the Belgæ and
Durotriges made a gallant resistance to Vespasian,
who marched against them with Legio II.
Thirteen fierce engagements were necessary before
the conquest was complete, and Vespasian on one
occasion owed his life to his son Titus, the future
destroyer of Jerusalem. But his work was very
thoroughly done, and within six years Roman rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
was firmly established as far as the Exe. The
wild Damnonii beyond that river were left now and
afterwards very much to themselves. No doubt
they made submission, but the great western road
never went beyond Isca Damnoniorum (Exeter).
The tin trade of Cornwall seems to have languished
during the Early and Middle Empire; but when in
the third century the mines once more began to
disgorge their treasures, the ingots were carried
to the sea on the backs of pack-animals. Until the
eighteenth century pack-trains with correspondingly
narrow tracks were the rule in Devon and Cornwall.
The famous bridge of Bideford was scarcely
more than wide enough to admit of the passage of
a loaded horse.</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 47, when Plautius went home to enjoy
a well-merited triumph, the whole south and east
of the island appeared to be passing with little
apparent effort into the form of a Roman province.
The frontier probably followed for the most part
the lines of the Lower Severn, Avon, and Welland,
but in the centre it bulged outwards around Ratæ
(Leicester). Here it would have been well for
Rome to have halted. The territory already
occupied was fairly settled, capable of great
development, and the frontier was easily defensible.
But a forward policy invariably brings
trouble in its train. In the North Midlands the
Coritani and Cornavii were restless, and behind them
the great Brigantian tribe, which held the whole
breadth of the North from Humber to Tyne, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
ever raiding. Still greater was the danger in Wales,
where the Silures of the south and the Ordovices
of the north were the fiercest warriors of Britain,
where was the Druids’ sacred home of Mona,
and where King Caradoc, the last warrior of
Caswallon’s famous line, had taken refuge.</p>

<p>Publius Ostorius Scapula, the new governor, had
perhaps no alternative to the ‘forward’ policy; at
any rate, he committed himself to it. He conquered
the weak Coritani and Cornavii with slight
difficulty, stationed Legio IX. at Lindum (Lincoln)
to keep guard over them, and established a colony
of time-expired veterans as a garrison for Camulodunum.
Then he turned upon Caradoc. Legio II.
moved forward from Glevum (Gloucester) to Isca
Silurum (Caerleon), while Scapula with the XIVth
and XXth established himself with his base at Viroconium,
the camp, afterwards the town, beside
Wrekin, whose ruins have been laid bare in our own
days. The men of Cambria were thrown on the
defensive by the great force directed against them.
Caradoc manœuvred among the mountains, harassed
the Roman line of march, cut off detachments, but
was at last brought to bay in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 50. All that could
be suggested to counterbalance the superiority of the
Romans in everything but mere numbers he did.
He posted his army behind a roaring mountain
torrent, with both flanks protected by craggy
heights, and his centre covered by ‘sangars’ of
piled stones. The wild warriors of Wales swore by
their gods to conquer or die. Caradoc rode up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
down the line, bade them save themselves and those
they loved from slavery and death, told them (with
justifiable stretching of truth) how his ancestors had
repulsed the mightiest of the Cæsars, and besought
them to do their duty to the last. They did not
fail him, but fortune was against them. The battle
was furiously contested, but the entrenchments were
stormed at last; and after bravely rallying in the
face of the legions and renewing the fray, the
Britons finally broke and fled. Caradoc’s wife and
daughter were taken captive in the camp, and the
king, fleeing for aid to the Brigantes, was surrendered
to the Romans by the Queen Cartimandua.
The story of how he and his family were dragged
in chains through Rome to make a holiday for its
cosmopolitan populace, and released by the kindly
Emperor, is well known. One could wish that the
old ruler, whose character has suffered so much at
the hands of detractors, had spared a brave man
and two helpless women the cruel humiliation of
public exposure as well. But probably no Roman
was capable of such generosity. Aurelian treated
Zenobia as Claudius treated Caradoc, and from the
bas-reliefs on the column of Arcadius we see that
the Christian Romans of the fourth century were
capable of dragging female captives, pinioned like
criminals, in triumphal procession.</p>

<p>Undismayed by the fate of their King, the Silures
fought on desperately. Again and again they
gained considerable guerrilla successes. Foraging
detachments were attacked; two cohorts destroyed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
a strong brigade of legionaries surrounded, severely
defeated, and only saved from destruction by the
arrival of reinforcements. Scapula died of vexation
and fatigue, and the Silures just afterwards attacked
and defeated a whole legion. Scapula’s successor,
Didius, was threatened by the Brigantes, who were
growing angry at the ignominious part to which
Cartimandua’s policy condemned them, and the
Cambrians, despite constant warfare, remained
unsubdued.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 59 C. Suetonius Paulinus, one of the best
soldiers of the Empire, took command in Britain,
and at once initiated a vigorous offensive. He
determined to turn the flank of Wales, as it were,
and strike a staggering blow by uprooting the
Druid stronghold in Mona. Didius appears to
have fortified Deva (Chester), and now Paulinus
enlarged it, moving the XIVth and XXth Legions
there from Viroconium, and making it his base for
the advance. In <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 60 he arrived on Menai
Strait with flat-bottomed boats for the transport of
his infantry. The Ordovician warriors were massed
on the shore of Mona to oppose the landing;
frantic women, clothed in black and bearing blazing
torches, with wild eyes and tossing hair, like the
Furies, as the superstitious soldiers muttered,
rushed about exhorting the men and screaming
curses at the hated Romans. Behind the Druids
were engaged in their dreadful rites, and the shrieks
of the perishing victims rang over the Strait. For
a while there was something like incipient panic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
among the Romans, but the fierce adjurations of
their officers steadied them, and when they had
effected a landing, burning with rage at their
hesitation, there was small hope for the Britons.
The fighting men were cut down in thousands,
women and children involved in the hideous
massacre. The Druids were slaughtered at their
rites, or tossed upon their own flaming pyres. The
sanctuaries were destroyed, the sacred groves cut
down, and Paulinus might hope that he had dealt a
decisive blow, when jaded messengers dashed into
camp with the stunning tidings that all Roman
Britain was in a flame of revolt.</p>

<p>The rebellion had been long brewing, and for it
the Roman civil and military administration, above
all the Roman capitalists, were to blame. To
create farms for retired veterans the military chiefs
had recklessly evicted native landowners. The
military settlers insulted and oppressed their British
neighbours. The discipline of the legions, relaxed
by years of guerrilla warfare, was probably bad, and
it would seem that Paulinus, a soldier before all,
was not the man to trouble himself about the rights
of civilians, especially if they were also barbarians.
The Imperial procurator (<i>i.e.</i>, practically financial
agent), Decianus Catus, was calling for the repayment
of various loans advanced by Claudius to
chiefs; presumably Nero needed money for his
expensive pleasures. The British chiefs were careless
and ostentatious, and, now that they could not
enrich themselves by plunder in war, were apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
borrow heavily&mdash;of course, from Roman capitalists.
Many of them were hopelessly embarrassed, unable
to pay the iniquitous interest, much less the principal;
and the greedy usurers were only too ready to
drag them further into the toils. Nero’s famous
minister, the Stoic Seneca, was one of the worst
offenders. Usury was a chief source of his vast
income. Now, as if to add fuel to the smouldering
fire, he suddenly called in his British loans, 40,000,000
sesterces (£360,000). <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cherchez la femme!</i> say the
French when trouble threatens. No doubt the
saying is not without truth, but a study of history,
and especially of Roman history, leads rather to the
conclusion that the greed of the speculator has been
responsible for a great deal of the world’s misery.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture died Prasutagus, King of the
Iceni. He made the Emperor heir to his kingdom,
and joint inheritor of his vast personal wealth,
evidently in the hope that his widow Boudicca and
her two daughters would thereby be assured of
protection. Paulinus and Catus must share the
blame for what followed. The country of the
Iceni was treated like conquered territory. Military
violence went hand in hand with civil spoliation.
The widowed queen was actually whipped by the
scoundrels who dishonoured the Roman name; her
orphaned daughters were foully outraged. One
can only hope that the vile deeds were committed
by one or two especially degraded creatures; but
neither their associates who looked on, nor those
who sent them, can escape blame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
It was the last straw. The Iceni rose as one
man at the call of their outraged Queen. Tall and
stately of presence, with bright eyes and thick,
flowing, red-gold hair, was the sorely wronged
widow of Prasutagus, and as, splendid in the
barbaric magnificence of a British queen, she
harangued her liegemen, told of violence and
lashes, and insults unmentionable, pointed to the
shame-bowed forms of her violated children, the
rage of the Iceni rose to fever heat. Out from the
bounds of their country poured the wild barbaric
host, and ill fared it with the Roman who strayed
across its path. News of the rising came all too
late. Quintus Petilius Cerealis at Lindum called in
all that he could of the IXth Legion and marched
southward, but the Iceni had a long start. On
they rushed across Suffolk towards doomed Camulodunum,
the Trinobantes rallying to them with
fierce unanimity. ‘Colonia Victrix’ had no walls;
only the temple of Divus Claudius and some neighbouring
buildings formed a sort of citadel. Catus
sent what soldiers he could&mdash;only two hundred&mdash;to
help the colonists in the defence; but time was
lacking wherein to raise entrenchments, and little
had been done when the Britons were at hand, and
swept through the city in a whirlwind of vengeance
and destruction. Some of the defenders held out
for two days in the temple, then it, too, was taken.
There were hideous scenes. The outrage-maddened
princesses were little likely to restrain their furious
tribesmen. The innocent perished with the guilty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
without distinction of age or sex; women were
stripped, scourged, horribly mutilated, and left to
die a lingering death of agony impaled on stakes.
Such was the harvest of the seed sown by military
oppression and capital-owning greed.</p>

<p>Now followed a great but obscure campaign.
Tacitus is a little less vague than usual, but gives
not a hint as to chronology. The main point is
that London was already the most important place
in the island. This is clearly indicated, but everything
else is exceedingly difficult to follow. So far
as can be ascertained, the sequence of events was this:
Boudicca, having destroyed Camulodunum, faced
round to meet Cerealis, who was approaching from
Lindum. His force was attacked by the raging
horde of Britons and practically annihilated. Some
3,000 legionaries and many auxiliaries perished;
only the remains of the cavalry, with Cerealis, cut
their way out and escaped.</p>

<p>Paulinus meanwhile was hastening to the scene
of operations. He left, perforce, a strong garrison
in Deva, and marched for London with the XIVth
Legion, some picked cohorts of the XXth, some
auxiliaries, and cavalry. He sent off orders to the
IInd and IXth Legions to join him. A glance at
the map of Roman Britain will show that London
was the natural place of concentration.</p>

<p>We may assume that Cerealis’s action in marching
from Lindum had, at any rate, drawn the Britons
away from the vital point. Paulinus reached London
before Boudicca. Then the blow fell. No troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
were there. The IXth Legion, we know, had been
destroyed. Pœnius Postumus, the temporary commander
of the IInd, paralyzed by the responsibility,
perhaps thought fit to transmit the order to his
absent superior, and at any rate stood fast on the
Lower Severn. London was not fortified&mdash;it must
have been crowded with fugitives&mdash;and Paulinus’s
entire strength, according to Tacitus, was but 10,000
men. There is really no reason to believe, as has
been suggested, that he had outpaced his army and
had only his escort with him. The position is quite
clear. He had ordered a concentration at London,
and it had failed. Instead of 20,000 men or more, he
had only 10,000 wherewith to defend an open town
crowded with refugees. He decided that London
must be abandoned. Of its population, swollen,
probably, by much of that of Verulam, those who
had most to fear&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Continental residents&mdash;followed
the march. Some, doubtless, escaped on
shipboard, but many, probably those of British
birth, remained.</p>

<p>Conjecture has been busy with the direction of
Paulinus’s march. The old view was that he moved
on Camulodunum; the more modern one, followed
by most recent writers, is that he retreated on Deva
to rally its garrison. Neither, however, commends
itself to the authors. Let us study the position.</p>

<p>Paulinus at London had 10,000 combatants in hand
but was burdened with a mass of non-combatants at
least equal in number. At and about Deva were
perhaps half a legion and auxiliaries&mdash;say, 5,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
men. At Lindum, practically blockaded, were the
remains of the IXth. About Isca Silurum and on
the Lower Severn was the IInd Legion with its
auxiliaries. At Viroconium and other places in the
west, and in some of the Kentish towns (<i>i.e.</i>,
Rutupiæ), there were certainly garrisons. The
British host was somewhere north-east of London.</p>

<p>The question of supplies must be considered.
It was probably near harvest-time, as the Welsh
campaign and the subsequent operations would have
consumed most of the summer. The richest districts
of Britain were Essex, Kent, and the Lower
Severn Valley; but Essex was in the hands of the
Britons, and Paulinus could draw no supplies from it.</p>

<p>Wherever Paulinus went he had to feed his army
and its hapless incubus of refugees. The London-Deva
road traversed the thinly-peopled and thickly-wooded
Midlands; the way to Colchester was barred
by the Britons.</p>

THE TIME OF PAULINUS’S ARRIVAL IN LONDON.</p>

<p class="hang">The chief roads (mainly British trackways) are shown with broken lines. Each
infantry block roughly indicates 5,000 men. The whole country north of the
Thames was hostile to the Romans, perhaps much of that to the south also.
The Roman troops at Lindum (Lincoln) were only the defeated remnant of the
IXth Legion. It should be noted that of the settled and corn-growing districts,
one was occupied by the Britons, and there remained open for Paulinus’s army,
and the crowd of refugees which accompanied it, the choice between Kent or
the Lower Severn Valley. The IInd Legion at Isca Silurum (Caerleon) had
orders to march on Londinium, and Paulinus would expect it to be well on its
way. The heavy black line stretching south-west from London indicates the
probable direction of the Roman retreat.</p></div></div>

<p>The object of Paulinus was to complete his frustrated
combination. At Deva, two hundred miles
away, were perhaps 5,000 men; at Lindum, a
hundred and thirty miles to the north-east, perhaps
an equal force, dispirited by defeat. If he took the
road to Deva, or that to Lindum, he would have the
Britons upon him. Is it conceivable that this
able general, with supply difficulties aggravated by
his mass of non-combatants, would deliberately
plunge into the midst of the enemy, in order to
join one of his two smaller detachments, when in
the Lower Severn Valley lay a whole legion and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a><br /></span>
auxiliaries. If his orders were being obeyed, it
should be already on the march; but if it had not
yet concentrated, its nearest detachments were only
a hundred miles away. A study of the map will
show that, if London were abandoned, Corinium
(Cirencester) would be the natural point of concentration
for Paulinus’s army, the IInd Legion, and
the garrisons of Deva and Viroconium. The troops
round Lindum and the garrisons in Kent must, for
the moment, be left to themselves. We are justified
in thinking that Paulinus would move in the direction
of his largest outlying corps&mdash;the IInd Legion.
Considerations of supply would also take him westward.
Food might be found in Kent, but not
reinforcements. The conclusion is that, for every
reason, the direction of the retreat would be westward.
Paulinus no doubt crossed the Thames, presumably
by the bridge at London, which would, of
course, afterwards be destroyed, and retreated
towards Calleva (Silchester).</p>

<p>It is probable that Verulam was taken and
sacked by the Britons after Paulinus had passed
through it. Tacitus only says that it fell at about
the same time as London. The British host then
moved on to London, which shared the fate of
Camulodunum and Verulam. The massacre here
was probably the worst, for it would, naturally, apart
from its commercial importance, be full of fugitives.</p>

<p>From the ruins of London the Britons moved on
after Paulinus, who was marching slowly, troubled,
so Dion says, with want of supplies, and encumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
with the refugees from London. Another massacre
would have taken place but for the fact that before
the pursuers could get at the victims they must
reckon with the ten thousand desperate veterans
who formed the rearguard. But the danger grew
greater. The Roman army was too small to
adequately guard the unhappy throng of fugitives
that impeded its march; the IInd Legion did not
come, and Paulinus turned to bay. He chose a
strong position in a defile, with woods behind and
on both flanks. His legionaries were deployed
across the entrance; the light troops apparently
along the front and in the woods; the cavalry
behind. This narrow valley may reasonably be
looked for among the hills between the south-west
of London and Silchester, and as the most open,
and therefore safest, route would have probably
been by Banstead, Epsom Downs, Headley, Ranmore,
and Guildford, the scene of Boudicca’s defeat
may be somewhere along that line. The retreating
Romans would, in this case, have quite likely debouched
into the gorge of the Mole by the valley
that runs into it from Headley. Continuing their
westward march, the way up to the top of the downs
would be almost facing them as they crossed the
shallow river where Burford Bridge now stands. It
is conceivable that the idea of turning to bay at this
point would occur to Paulinus as his force marched
up the dry and rapidly narrowing valley, whose sides
are sufficiently steep to concentrate the attack on
one front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
The generalship of the British chiefs appears to
have been contemptible. They staked everything
on a wild frontal attack. Worse still, their movements
were encumbered by hordes of followers and
a vast train of waggons, which was parked confusedly
in the rear. For the last time Boudicca
drove along the line and bade her warriors strike
a crushing blow. Paulinus, on his side, addressed
his men in brief soldierly words, which Dion amplifies
into an harangue covering pages.</p>

<p>The Britons, as they came on, were smitten by
storms of missiles from the light troops, which made
havoc in their dense masses, but the headlong charge,
nevertheless, seems to have driven in the skirmishers
and reached the legionaries. But they were received
with volley on volley of pila; rush after rush recoiled
from the steady line; and then, when the fury of
their charge began to slacken, Paulinus ordered the
advance. The legionaries pressed forward shoulder
to shoulder, like a wall of iron; the auxiliaries
charged manfully on the wings of their heavily-armed
comrades. As the line left the defile the
cavalry swept round the flanks and fell upon the
Britons, and though bodies and individuals doubtless
fought bravely to the end, panic seized the host
as a whole, and it fled wildly to the rear. The fatal
waggon park dammed back the flying horde, and
the Romans closed upon it and slaughtered their
fill. The massacres of the Britons were avenged by
the butchery, it is said, of 80,000 men, women, and
children. Like many of the semi-barbarous peoples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of the past, and the Abyssinians of to-day, their armies
were encumbered by a numerous following of women-folk.
Boudicca poisoned herself in her despair.</p>

<p>With the victory of Paulinus the last united
opposition to Rome ceased. The reconquest of
the south gave much trouble, and Paulinus himself
was soon recalled, rightly enough, for his harshness
and lack of political wisdom were clearly not less
than his warlike skill. Civilian governors set to
work to heal, so far as possible, the wounds of
Britain, and for eight years the new policy of conciliation
and reorganization was steadily carried out.
After 71 the conquest of the Brigantes in the North
was taken seriously in hand by Petilius Cerealis,
now governor of the province. The brave Silures
of South Wales submitted in 78, and the northern
tribes were by 80 sufficiently cowed to enable that
brilliant but overrated figure, Gnæus Julius Agricola,
the father-in-law of Tacitus, to make his famous invasions
of Caledonia. But in 86 they again broke
out into revolt, and for thirty years gave continual
trouble. About 119 they set upon Legio IX., the
ever luckless ‘Hispana’&mdash;where is unfortunately
not known&mdash;and annihilated it; never more does it
appear in the Imperial muster-rolls. The subjection
of the North seemed as far distant as ever.</p>

<p>So in 120 the Emperor Hadrian himself arrived
in Britain to study the problem, bringing with him,
to replace the lost troops, Legio VI. (‘Victrix’), whose
headquarters were to be at Eboracum (York) for
nearly three hundred years. He decided to draw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
connected line of defence across the island from
Tynemouth to Solway, which might serve at once
as a bulwark against the North, and a base of
operations against the Brigantes. The idea had
been Agricola’s, thus showing that some at least
of his relative’s overstrained eulogy is not misplaced.
The line of forts which he had established was now
reinstated, new ones built, and all connected by a
solid rampart of turf, fronted by a deep ditch.
While this was being carried out, and Hadrian was
busy in the south, the field army, assisted by
detachments from the Army of the Rhine, set to
work to tame the Brigantes, and for a time
succeeded.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE ROMAN WALL FROM THE MILE CASTLE BETWEEN AESICA AND BORCOVICUS.</div></div>

<p>Hadrian’s policy, as is known, was to withdraw
behind definite and easily defensible frontiers, and
concentrate the energies of the government upon
internal development rather than aggression. The
trouble in Britain was that a true frontier was
hard to find. Hadrian’s chosen line corresponded
roughly with the Brigantian border, but it cut
athwart the British tribes. To move on to the
Forth was merely to add a large tract of very wild
and sparsely peopled territory to the province, with
the restless Brigantes still unsubdued far in the
rear. As the conditions then were, Hadrian’s
policy was sound; but it may be said, in short,
that the original error of occupying the island was
not to be redeemed by anything short of its complete
conquest, and for this task, enormously
difficult and entirely unremunerative, the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Empire, on the verge of decline in population and
resources, had not the means.</p>

<p>Hadrian’s Wall is now crowned, except at one
point, by the reconstruction in stone by Severus I.
ninety years later; hence it was often supposed
that the first wall was a stone structure. This idea
may now be regarded as thoroughly disproved; the
later wall stands upon and hides the foundations of
the former, but near Birdoswald Severus’s engineers
diverged a little from Hadrian’s line, and the earlier
emperor’s construction may still be seen. The
turf wall, replaced by stone, ran for seventy-three
miles from Gabrosentum (Bowness) to Segedunum
(Wallsend). In front of it, where it did not crown
precipitous cliffs, was a ditch about 36 feet broad,
and perhaps 30 feet deep. At each milestone there
was a redoubt (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">castellum</i>), and at more or less
regular intervals along the whole line were fifteen
large forts. Roughly parallel to the wall ran a
military road, and a little way south of it a wide but
shallow ditch between mounds, commonly called the
‘Vallum,’ the reason for which is a puzzle. It is
best here to adopt Professor Oman’s very reasonable
theory that it was the civil boundary of the
province.</p>

<p>The wall and its forts were constructed by detachments
from the legions, but it was garrisoned
by the auxiliary cohorts, while the heavy infantry
lay in reserve at the old military centres. Twenty-one
infantry cohorts and six <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">alæ</i> of cavalry made
up the original garrison, and some of them kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
their stations for centuries. Nearly three hundred
years later there were at least eleven, and probably
more, of these regiments still on the wall. Behind,
the legions occupied their camps for generation after
generation, as if nothing could disturb them. For
two hundred and eighty-two years after Hadrian’s
visit, Legio VI. lay at York. The XXth ‘Valeria
Victrix’ made its home at Deva (Chester) for more
than three centuries; while Secunda Augusta, which
had landed with Plautius in 43, did not leave Britain
until 407, after a sojourn of three hundred and sixty-four
years!</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ROMAN PROVINCE AND THE EARLIER
TEUTONIC INVASIONS</span></h2>

<p>After Hadrian, in what Florus jokingly termed the
great Emperor’s ‘walking about Britain,’ had reorganized
the island, and established the famous
military frontier, Britain settled down to a more
or less eventful existence as a Roman province.
The unfortunate results of the enterprise, into which
Claudius had perhaps been led partly against his
will, soon began to be apparent, even if to all
thinking men they were not plain as early as the
reign of Hadrian. The military boundary chosen
by Trajan’s successor corresponded roughly with
the northern border of the Brigantes, but it was
not the frontier of Britain, which extended from
Clyde to Forth. Therefore, in 140-141, the governor,
Lollius Urbicus, the lieutenant of Antoninus Pius,
moved the frontier forward to this line, and covered
it by another rampart, strengthened by ten forts,
only a few miles apart. It was the old, old story&mdash;a
forward policy can never halt.</p>

<p>The Roman terminus stood between Forth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Clyde for a few years only. The wild Caledonians&mdash;‘Picts,’
as perhaps the Roman troops were
already calling them&mdash;saw their independence
threatened now as formerly by Agricola. About
155 the irrepressible Brigantes again broke out
into rebellion. They were only subdued after a
fierce struggle, during which the garrison of the
northernmost wall must have been largely recalled.
The result was the gradual abandonment of the
recently occupied territory. The Caledonians raided
through the ill-occupied wall, inflicted at least one
severe defeat on a Roman force, and, as excavations
appear to show, stormed some of the forts. By
about 190 the frontier was again at Hadrian’s Wall,
with advanced stations at Habitancum (Risingham)
and Bremenium (High Rochester), respectively twelve
and twenty miles from Corstopitum (Corbridge), just
south of the Wall, Castra Exploratorum (Netherby),
and one or two other places. So, after every effort,
the ‘British Enterprise’ ended in an unsatisfactory
compromise. The Roman frontier was neither
ethnic nor natural, and the wretched Britons between
Roman and Pict were literally between
hammer and anvil. In 196-197 the governor,
Decimus Clodius Albinus, took almost the entire
army to Gaul to contest the Empire with Severus I.
He was defeated and slain at Lugdunum (Lyons),
and the troops returned to Britain; but they must
have suffered very heavily, besides being thoroughly
discontented with the Emperor, who had slain their
own commander. This weakness and disorganization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
gave the wild Caledonians too good an opportunity
to be missed. They appear to have occupied
the territory north of the Wall, and even to have
crossed the fortified line itself.</p>

<p>So in 208 Severus himself arrived with powerful
reinforcements. In 209 he advanced, and for two
years pushed slowly and doggedly forward. His
solution of the problem was the heroic one of subduing
the whole island. The losses of the army
in the two campaigns were relatively enormous&mdash;fifty
thousand men, it is said. The stern old
Emperor was generally ill; he suffered fearfully
from gout, but he never faltered. On over the
desolation of wild Caledonia, slowly, painfully, but
with a grim determination more terrible than the
fiercest onslaught, with Severus in his litter at its
head, the devoted army wrought its way, and at
last drew near to the ‘extreme end of the Isle of
Britain.’<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Severus had won his last victory, for
the barbarians were cowed by the steady advance.
They sued for peace, and the grim old conqueror
returned to Eboracum to die. His worthless son
Caracalla retroceded the conquered territory to
the Picts, receiving in exchange a more or less
nominal homage; but there is every reason to
believe that the barbarians were daunted, and gave
little trouble for many years. Severus left behind
him, as a perpetual monument to his greatness, the
gigantic reconstruction in stone of Hadrian’s Wall,
whereof the remains survive to this day.</p>

<p>After his departure, Britain entered upon a period
of prosperity hitherto unknown. It was saved by
its insular position from taking more than a passive
part in the wild chaos of civil and foreign war that
overwhelmed the Roman Empire in the third century,
and is described by a contemporary writer as being
in a very flourishing condition. The Picts were held
completely in check by the fortified lines of the Wall.
Perhaps, also, they were involved in warfare among
themselves. At any rate, not until the end of the
century did Britain again know the fear of foreign
invasion. This time it was not from the North, but
from oversea. The little cloud, no bigger than a
man’s hand, had arisen in Germany, which was to
grow until it overshadowed all the heavens, and
ended by forming a new nation on what had been
Celtic soil.</p>

<p>For long generations Germania had been seething
with disorder, for reasons which cannot here be considered.
Tribe was pressing on tribe; the whole
mass of wild barbarism was being forced against the
Rhine and the Danube, behind which lay the Roman
Empire, sorely weakened by invasions, plague,
famine, economic decay, and misgovernment.
The North-German tribes&mdash;Franks, Saxons,
Angles, Jutes, Frisians&mdash;finding raids over the
Rhine difficult, dangerous, and more and more
unremunerative, began to take to the sea. Their
craft as yet&mdash;perhaps to the end&mdash;were small open
vessels, incapable of rough sea-work, and obliged
to hug the shore as far as possible. The raiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
flotillas ran down what are now the coasts of Denmark,
North-West Germany, and Holland, and
turned to right or left on Britain or Gaul, according
to information or inclination. Others, more daring,
or encouraged by spells of fine weather, ran across
from Frisia to the coasts of Essex, Suffolk, and
Norfolk, and landed for hasty raids on those rich
agricultural districts. These appear at first to have
been met merely by detachments of troops; the
Roman naval force in the Channel was small. But
when the famous organizer and statesman, Diocletian,
took up the task of saving the Empire in 284, he
abandoned timid defensive strategy. His colleague,
Maximianus, to whom he entrusted the West,
organized a great fleet in the Channel, and placed
in command a distinguished naval officer, Marcus
Aurelius Carausius, with the title of ‘Count of the
Saxon Shore.’ He cleared the sea of the pirates,
but, presently accused of misappropriation of booty,
set up in Britain as independent ruler. He even
endeavoured to conquer Gaul, but only succeeded in
permanently holding Gessoriacum (Boulogne). His
naval power, however, rendered his position invulnerable,
and Diocletian and Maximianus stooped
to acknowledge him as their colleague. He was
assassinated in 293, but his murderer and successor,
Allectus, held the province for three years longer.
He was not the equal of Carausius, and allowed
Constantius Chlorus, Cæsar of the West, to build
ships unmolested in Gaul until he was able to cross
the Channel and overthrow Allectus (296).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Constantius and his more famous son, Constantine
the Great, resided for long periods in Britain, and,
partly to this circumstance, partly to the renewed
peace brought about by the protection of the fleet
of the Saxon Shore, the province enjoyed another
lease of prosperity. Indeed, there is some reason
to believe that the period 296-350 was the most
prosperous that Roman Britain ever knew. Building
was going on vigorously. When Constantius II.
rebuilt Augustodunum in Gaul he levied artisans for
the work in Britain, a circumstance which points to
a condition of great prosperity. The western mines
were being actively worked; Damnonia (Devon and
Cornwall) was evidently being drawn much more
closely into the Roman sphere of civilization.
Something of the same kind seems to have been
taking place north of the Wall, though here the
Imperial influence was of a much fainter character.</p>

<p>Something must be said of the towns. They
were not numerous or specially important. It
must be remembered that Britain as a province was
comparatively poor and unsettled as compared with
Spain or Asia Minor. Its relative prosperity at
this period was thrown into relief by the fact that
Gaul had long been suffering from barbarian invasions;
it is not improbable that there had been
immigration from the Continent. To return to the
towns: Camulodunum seems never to have recovered
from its destruction by Boudicca. When
it was rebuilt, its walls enclosed an area less than
that of several other places. Glevum, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Lindum, were <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">colonia</i>; Verulam had been a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">municipium</i>
since the commencement of the Roman
epoch. Eboracum was undoubtedly the principal
place north of the Trent; Corinium, Viroconium,
Calleva, Isca Silurum, and other places, had considerable
local importance. Aquæ Sulis was much
frequented as a health resort; but the most important
city of the province from the time of
Carausius onwards was undoubtedly London, which
about 340 received the title of Augusta, with, in all
probability, exceptional privileges. Its name was
far too ancient to be ousted by a mere honorary
appellation, but Londinium Augusta was certainly
the largest and most important, if not the finest,
of Romano-British towns. Its walls enclosed an
area of some 380 acres. The average of population
per acre in modern London is about sixty, but
in Berlin it is one hundred. Sanitation was ill-understood
in those days, and in a commercial centre like
London the crowding was probably often dense.
The normal population may have been about 50,000.
The area of Verulam was about 203 acres; its population,
perhaps, 20,000. Such importance as it still
retained may have been largely due to the fact that
it was a pleasant place of resort from busy and overcrowded
London. Viroconium, with an area of
170 acres, and Calleva with 102, can hardly be
credited with more than 10,000 and 5,000 inhabitants
respectively. Population does not flock into places
of no special commercial importance. Glevum,
Lindum, Eboracum, and Corinium were all, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
as large as Verulamium. Many of the ports on the
south coast must have attained considerable size.
But Britain, unlike Gaul, was not a province of great
cities. Apart from resorts of merchants, such as
London, the real centres of social life seem to have
been the numerous villas.</p>

<p>Nor, apart from prosperity at certain periods, can
Britain ever have been a paying province. The
number of troops permanently maintained there
must have approached 40,000; while Severus was in
the island there were probably 100,000; in 400 the
Notitia shows over 50,000. Besides the expense of
the army, there was that of the vast and ever-increasing
bureaucracy, and of the maintenance of
roads and military works.</p>

<p>When the chief towns were walled we do not
know. There is some reason to think that the
fortification of London was begun by Severus I.,
but it is probable that most of the wall dates from a
later period. The opinion of the authors, based
upon careful examination of the quality of the work,
is that it was constructed in great haste. The wall
of Verulam is especially strong and massive, but
whether it is so early as it is claimed to be is somewhat
doubtful. Inscriptions are plentiful on the
Wall of Severus, but not on those of the towns; and
since the practice of commemorative inscriptions
tended to die out in the fourth century, we are,
perhaps, justified in supposing that the fortification
of the towns was undertaken comparatively late.
Everything is doubtful at present. We only know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
that the ‘departure of the Eagles’ left most of the
British towns walled. Since at Silchester the wall
crosses the ends of streets diagonally, the inference
is that it was built at a late date to enclose only the
closely inhabited area.</p>

<p>About 343 the Picts, hitherto more or less
quiescent, again took to the war-path. Apparently
the defences of the North had been somewhat
neglected; the Wall of Severus was pierced,
Corstopitum burned. The Emperor Constans
came in haste from Gaul in the winter to face the
danger, drove back the raiders, and appears to have
received some sort of homage from them, for
Julius Firmicus speaks of the Emperor as having
‘extended the Empire.’ His coercion was at any
rate severe enough to impose peace for seventeen
years. But in 360 troubles again broke out. The
Picts renewed their raids, and for the first time we
hear of a new enemy to Britain&mdash;the Scots. They
were destined to give their name to the northern
part of Britain in the far future, but for the present
they were probably neither more nor less than
adventurers from Ireland. The name may signify
a ‘broken’ or landless man, though the Scots as a
whole appear to have had their home in north-east
Ireland. Perhaps they were a confederation of
broken clans and war-bands. They crossed to
Caledonia, and established a settlement in the
modern Argyll. At the same time some of the
Picts had effected a small settlement in Ireland and
in Galloway. The two peoples were thus in close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
communication, and a united attack from them was
what might have been expected.</p>

<p>About 360, then, Picts and Scots began to direct
raids upon the north and west of Roman Britain.
After a while they were joined by the Attacotti, who
seem to have been a confederation of the Britons
beyond the Roman Wall&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, between Tyne and
Forth. For a time these raids produced only slight
effect, and in 360 Britain was exporting quantities
of grain to Gaul for the relief of suffering provincials
there. But by 364 the invaders were
growing more daring. There is reason to think
that other Irish tribes were assisting them, and now
the ‘Saxons’&mdash;that is Angles, Frisians, Jutes, as
well as Saxons&mdash;appear once more on the scene.
Ammianus Marcellinus says that they were ‘in
conspiracy’&mdash;that is, were acting in unison&mdash;and this
is very probable. In 367 they made a combined
attack and broke up the defence by two almost
simultaneous victories. The Roman Army of the
North was defeated; its commander, Fullofaudes,
was slain, and the force broken up and dispersed;
while Nectarides, Count of the Saxon Shore, was
defeated and slain by the Saxons. The results
were very serious. Probably here and there
detachments of troops held out behind the walls
of the larger towns and fortresses; but the invaders
seem to have overrun a great part of the country north
of the Thames. Ammianus says that they dispersed
over the country in small marauding bands.</p>

<p>The Emperor Valentinian I. sent to cope with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
this most dangerous irruption a gallant Spanish
officer, Theodosius, entrusting to him large reinforcements
of Teutonic mercenaries and two
regiments of the Imperial Guard. Theodosius’s
first care was to clear the Midlands, a task involving
much rapid marching and hard fighting, but successfully
carried out. He wisely did not threaten
disbanded troops with military punishment, and
thus was able to rally the Army of Britain on the
corps which accompanied him, and to completely
reorganize it. In 369 he cleared the north, and,
so Claudian tells us, pursued the enemy oversea to
their refuges&mdash;presumably the Irish coast and the
Hebrides. Whatever exaggeration may be behind
the poet’s eulogy, there is no doubt that Theodosius
gained great and, for the time, decisive successes.
Although the theory of a new ‘province of Valentia’
between the Walls of Hadrian and Antoninus is due
to a misunderstanding of the words of Ammianus,
there is some reason to think that Theodosius did
in a sense advance the border. He abolished the
‘Arcani,’ a sort of frontier intelligence corps composed
of border Britons, and this may imply supersession
of them by advanced detachments of regulars.
Secondly, we find Attacotti soon after serving in
considerable numbers in the Roman army, a circumstance
which seems to imply complete defeat, if
not political subjection. Thirdly, while Ammianus
says that Theodosius restored all the frontier forts,
excavation appears to indicate that the line of the
Wall with its mile-castles was not repaired. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
evidence is not quite conclusive, for the remains of
the last occupation lying nearest to the surface
would be the first to perish. The frontier was
guarded in force till forty years later. This has
been contested by Mommsen, who suggested that
the roll of the Army of Britain in the Notitia
Dignitatum was copied from an earlier list in order
to hide the chasm caused by the destruction of
corps in the Picto-Scottish wars. Professor Oman
has satisfactorily rebutted this theory. He points
out that, though there is a remarkable survival of
old regiments, yet intermingled with them are many
with unquestionable fourth-century titles such as ‘The
Thundering Moors,’ ‘The Senior Lions,’ and ‘The
Bears of Valentinian.’ Claudian distinctly states
that to meet Alaric, Stilicho withdrew troops from
the North of Britain. Coins of Maximus (383-388)
have been found on the Wall, proving an occupation
until almost the end of the fourth century; and lacking,
as there is, information of any great disaster, it
cannot be asserted that the Roman hold on Britain
was not effective until the last. The case of the
Attacotti is suggestive, and there is evidence (some
of it certainly late) that the British tribes between the
walls were practically adjuncts of the province and
co-operating in its defence.</p>

<p>The arrangements of Theodosius sufficed to ensure
the safety of the province for some fourteen
years. That much damage had been inflicted is
certain, and perhaps Britain never entirely recovered
from the effects of the invasions of 364-368.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
It has been suggested that Deva, Viroconium, and
other towns in the west, had been destroyed by the
Scots; but this seems very doubtful. A fact to be
noted is that there was already a considerable
Teutonic element in the island in the shape of
many <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">numeri</i> formed out of prisoners taken in the
chronic wars on the Rhine. In 371 the Emperor
Valentinian sent over to Britain a whole Alemannic
sub-tribe.</p>

<p>In 383 the Army of Britain revolted against
Gratianus, the successor of Valentinian I., and
proclaimed as Emperor an able Spanish general,
Magnus Clemens Maximus, who held high command
in the island, but had been passed over by
Gratian’s ministers for promotion. The Picts and
Scots seized the opportunity to renew their raids,
but were repelled by Maximus, who then, however,
crossed to Gaul to expel Gratian. The troops
joined him, Gratian was murdered by one of his
officers, and Maximus became supreme over Gaul
and Spain. Gratian’s brother, Valentinian II.,
retained Italy for a while, but in 387 Maximus
expelled him. He hoped, perhaps, to repeat the
deeds of Constantine I., who had conquered the
whole empire from the West, but fate decreed
otherwise. In 388 Theodosius I., Emperor of the
East, son of Count Theodosius, came up against
him, and he was defeated at Aquileia, captured, and
executed.</p>

<p>Gildas says that, to defend himself against Theodosius,
Maximus stripped Britain of her warriors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
and so paved the way for the ruin that was to come.
This, however, is very doubtful, and Gildas cannot
be relied upon except for his own times. But
Claudian may be believed when he says that Britain
suffered from Pictish and Scottish raids, though he
no doubt paints his picture in the darkest colours.
The ‘Historia Brittonum’ says that about 385-390
the Scots were in possession of North Wales, but
that they were driven out by an army led by Cunedda
and his eight sons from the land of the Otadini&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the Lothians (Manau Gododin). If this statement&mdash;and
it is very precise&mdash;may be taken as
historical fact, it can only mean that the Otadini
now formed part of the province, and that an
auxiliary force led by one of their chiefs was
employed to clear North Wales of the Scots.
Cunedda was clearly a Romanized Briton; his
father Æternus and his grandfather Paternus
bear just the quaint names that were common
among Romans in the fourth century. It is possible
that Cunedda’s campaign was initiated by Maximus.
‘Maxim Gwledig’ (= Maximus Imperator) bulks
largely in British legend, and it is permissible to
suppose that there was some solid reason for the
respect paid to his memory. The theory that Wales,
and possibly Damnonia, were defended by their own
local levies accounts satisfactorily for the fact that in
the Notitia we find no regular troops stationed in
those regions. It also explains the early formation
of monarchical states among them, which is a feature
of the next century. Finally, if a large part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
warriors of the Otadini went to Wales, we might
expect to find the defence of the north weakened, and,
if Claudian may be trusted, this is what did happen.</p>

<p>When Theodosius the Great died in 395 the
Roman Empire was already sorely pressed, but for
more than ten years ruin was staved off by the
great Vandal Stilicho, guardian of the weak young
Emperor Honorius, and Commander-in-Chief in
the West. Amongst other things, he reorganized
the defences of Britain. The General in the North
was called the ‘Duke of the Britains’ (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dux Britanniarum</i>).
From Brancaster, in Norfolk, to Southampton
Water extended the district of the Count
of the Saxon Shore (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comes Littoris Saxonici</i>). Both
were under the supreme command of the Count of
the Britains (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comes Britanniarum</i>), who controlled
a reserve force which could be used at need to
strengthen either north or east. The VIth Legion
was still at York; the IInd was now at Rutupiæ;
and there were besides thirty-seven auxiliary regiments
of infantry and sixteen of cavalry&mdash;nearly
60,000 men in all. There were also two naval
squadrons&mdash;one stationed on the ‘Saxon Shore,’
the other off the Lancashire coast.</p>

<p>One most important fact must be kept steadily
in mind: the Army of Britain, though it contained
some foreign corps and a large number of soldiers
of foreign extraction, was in the main British in
composition and feeling. For centuries the troops
of each Roman province had been very largely
recruited locally, either by conscripts or the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of the soldiers themselves, often trained to camp-life
and war from their youth up. A so-called Moorish
cohort would perhaps not contain a single Moor,
and so on throughout the army. A regiment stationed
in Britain kept its name, but was made up
with British recruits.</p>

<p>In 402 King Alaric and the Visigoths set out to
invade Italy, and Stilicho was forced to weaken the
Army of Britain for the defence of Ravenna and
Rome. Among the troops withdrawn was the
VIth Legion&mdash;its long residence at York at last
at an end&mdash;and none of them ever came back; for
though Stilicho hurled invasion after invasion out
of Italy, on January 1, 406, a horde of Teutons
poured over the frozen Rhine and began to waste
Gaul. Like an army whose line has been pierced,
the provinces found the Germans interposed between
them, and Britain was cut off from Italy.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Army of Britain appears to have
decided that Honorius and Stilicho were useless
as defenders of the Empire, and resolved to
save it themselves&mdash;by mutinying! They selected
a certain Marcus as emperor, and almost immediately
murdered him. A second, named Gratianus, had the
same fate; but the third, Constantine, was made of
sterner stuff, and wore the purple for over three
years&mdash;perhaps because he was wise enough to
leave Britain. He decided to imitate the example
of ‘Maxim Gwledig,’ and crossed to Gaul in 407.
This is the event so often, and wrongly, called the
‘departure of the legions.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Constantine had been chosen Emperor in order
to carry out the task with which Stilicho had failed
to successfully grapple. Is it to be supposed that
he would have dared to leave Britain defenceless,
even had he so desired? The idea is absurd. He
no doubt took to Gaul a considerable force, which
must have been mainly British, and his chief
general, Gerontius (Geraint), was a Briton. But
to suppose that, as Gildas wails, the province was
left defenceless, and that the inhabitants were so
effeminate and cowardly as to be incapable of bearing
arms, cannot be allowed. It is certain that the
Britons were among the best fighting peoples of
the Empire, and when Constantine crossed to Gaul
in 407 he undoubtedly left his base properly garrisoned.
It is not even certain that the IInd Legion
left Britain.</p>

<p>Constantine laid hands on a great part of Gaul
and Spain&mdash;so far as they were not held by barbarians&mdash;and
marched down to the Rhone to oust
Honorius, who had just murdered his guardian
and principal stay, the great Stilicho. Gerontius,
however, revolted from him, and in 411 he was
besieged in Arelate (Arles), captured, and executed.
Meanwhile, what of Britain? In 409 came the first
mutterings of the coming storm. The Saxons and
their allies made raids both on Britain and Gaul.
Thereupon the provincials disowned Constantine,
who was clearly no more of a success than Stilicho,
expelled his officials, elected others of their own
choosing, raised new levies of troops, and repulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the raiders. This is vouched for by the chronicler
Zosimus. The ministers of Honorius, beset by
many troubles, had already sent word to the British
communities that they must defend themselves, and
the provincials probably regarded their action as one
of adherence to the legitimate Emperor as against
usurpers of the type of Constantine. Certainly there
was no conscious withdrawal from the Empire.</p>

<p>The course of events can only be dimly conjectured.
In the east the Romanized cities probably
took the lead. In the west and north matters
went differently. These regions were less civilized,
and the political unit was the tribe and not the city.
In North Wales Cunedda was practically king, and
small monarchial states soon sprang up elsewhere.
In the north, about 450, St. Patrick tells us of a
military state (Strathclyde), ruled by a chief whom
he calls Coroticus, who possessed both a paid army
and a fleet, and had not only beaten off the Scots,
but had made retaliating raids on Ireland. Both
Cunedda and Coroticus are called Gwledig (overlord)
in the Welsh genealogies, and Cunedda at
least appears to have held the post of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dux Britanniarum</i>
(General of the Northern Frontier). Apparently
after his death a new state named Reged
arose on the Wall; it was founded by Coel&mdash;the
‘Old King Cole’ of an irreverent nursery rhyme.
Speaking roughly, we may say that in South Wales
and Damnonia tribal kingdoms, in North Wales
and the north-west military states, were the rule;
while the cities apparently kept up Roman traditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and by means of their walls maintained independence.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in many ways the outlook
was bad for Britain. The interests of the military
chiefs of the tribal dynasts and of the Romanized
cities were certain to diverge, and hostilities between
them were almost inevitable. Probably even
the cities did not always find co-operation easy.
It is possible that there were already numbers of
Teutons in the country; there may have been
Teutonic settlements on the coast of Lothian as
early as 400. The fleet of the Saxon Shore had
apparently disappeared, presumably during the
troubled period 407-411. Finally, the country
lacked the unifying bond of a common religion.
It is practically certain that though the Christian
Church in Britain was a vigorous organization,
its adherents were in a minority. The church at
Calleva is so small as to make it certain that the
Christian population was only some hundreds in
number, the total of inhabitants being, perhaps,
5,000. The fragments of a local god were found
by the explorers around its pedestal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
statue was standing there when disaster overtook
the place. When St. Germanus visited Britain
in 429 he baptized thousands of converts. Probably
in Britain, as elsewhere in the failing Empire, the
adhesion of the upper classes to Christianity was
nominal or non-existent, as it was to be for some
generations; and the majority among the masses
was frankly pagan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Thus divided, distracted, with a defensive system
disorganized by repeated withdrawals or shifting of
troops, and with little prospect of co-operation
between its cities and tribal cantons, Britain had to
face attacks from three sides. On the north were
the restless Picts, on the west the Scots, on the
east the Teutons.</p>

<p>To construct anything like a connected narrative
out of the few authorities who shed light on this
period is almost, if not quite, impossible. The whole
epoch has been called the ‘lost period,’ but it would
not be by any means unfair to describe it as neglected.
The authorities are scanty, obscure, and hopelessly
confused; but it is possible, by careful study, to
construct a not improbable skeleton of facts.</p>

<p>From 409 to 429 we have no clear indication of
the course of events in Britain. It seems, however,
to have been somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>Internally the process of reorganization with city
states, tribal principalities, and military monarchies
went on, probably with much jarring and intestine
strife, of which there are indications in Gildas, and the
queer mosaic of fairy tales, legends, genealogies,
and scraps of lost chronicles called the ‘Historia
Brittonum.’ The most remarkable fact is that the
Picts and Teutons were in communication, and acted
at times in conjunction. Various statements in the
Life of St. Germanus, and in the ‘Historia Brittonum’
lead one to infer that the earliest settlements of the
English in Britain were neither in the south nor the
east, but on the Firth of Forth. According to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Northumbrian genealogies in the ‘Historia Brittonum,’
Soemil, the predecessor of Aella of Deira,
in the fifth generation, was the first to separate
Deira from Bernicia. This must mean that he
founded a Teutonic principality in the north-east.
Bernicia is, apparently, a corruption of Brigantia
(Bryneich, or Berneich, in the ‘Historia’).</p>

<p>If, as early as 420 (Soemil can hardly be placed
much later), the Angles were able to effect permanent
settlements in north-east Britain, they were
probably raiding there years before. That their raids,
more or less in conjunction with the Picts, penetrated
a considerable distance south is also probable, though
the establishment of the kingdoms of Strathclyde and
Reged in this quarter tended to check them. It
was probably during the intestine struggles, which
resulted in the founding of these states, that the
English effected their lodgments. The men of
Strathclyde and Reged soon began a series of fierce
attacks upon them, and for a century and a half
they were confined to narrow, and perhaps disconnected,
slips of coast; but once established, they
were never really dislodged. The Britons, who
had the Picts and Scots also on their hands, and
were further distracted by dynastic broils, never
made the united attack which might have driven
the English, to use Napoleon’s famous phrase, ‘into
the sea.’</p>

<p>In the west the Britons were probably more
occupied with the Scots and Irish than with Picts,
though it is highly probable that German pirate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
squadrons occasionally harassed the south-west. In
Lancashire and western Yorkshire was the kingdom
of Theyrnllwg, and to the east another called
Elmet, whose capital was Loidis (Leeds). Both
these states may have represented sub-tribes of the
Brigantes. In the western Midlands was the kingdom
of Powys, and in the south-west Damnonia.
In Wales there were at least three states, probably
corresponding to the old tribal cantons of the Ordovices,
Silures, and Demetæ. Gwynedd, under the
dynasty of Cunedda, appears to have been generally
regarded as the chief state, and the suzerainty of its
kings was sometimes effective. There are indications
that Cunedda, at least, ruled both Gwynedd
and Theyrnllwg, but, as usual in Celtic dynasties,
his successors divided his heritage.</p>

<p>On the whole, it seems, as is natural, that while the
British states were in course of formation, the Picts
and Scots were able to raid the province with comparative
success for some years. About 425 Dathi,
Ard-righ (suzerain king) of Ireland, is said, in the
Irish annals, to have been slain oversea; and this
may have occurred on a raid against the Britons. In
429 Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, who had formerly
been ‘Dux’ of Aremorica, and Lupus, Bishop of
Troyes, came to Britain to combat the Pelagian
heresy which had sprung up in the island. It is
curious that a Church which had so far failed to
Christianize the province could produce a heresiarch
like Pelagius; but the phenomenon is not by any
means unparalleled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Germanus was one of those fine men about
whom all that was best of society rallied in those
terrible days. One biography of him, written by a
Gallic priest, survives; another, probably composed
in Britain, is lost, but was known to one of the
compilers of the ‘Historia Brittonum.’</p>

<p>Germanus and Lupus met their Pelagian opponents
in synod at Verulam. We are told that they
worshipped at the tomb of St. Alban; and as this
lay outside the walls, it may be considered as certain
that the south-east had not been visited by raiders.
The sanctity of the spot explains the choice of it as
the meeting-place. We might rather have expected
London, but it is noteworthy that St. Paul’s is said
to have been built on the site, not of a former
church, but of a temple of Apollo; and it is possible
that London, a great resort of merchants, was rather
a stronghold of eclecticism, if not paganism, than of
Christianity.</p>

<p>The Gallic bishops had other and more mundane
work to do before they departed. Some part of the
island, probably the north-east, was being wasted
by a joint invasion of Picts and ‘Saxons.’ There
must have been men in the British levies opposing
them who had heard of Germanus as a soldier&mdash;officers
and men of the old Imperial cohorts&mdash;and a
message was sent begging the Gallic bishops to join
the camp. The point upon which the biographer
dwells is naturally the conversion and baptism on
the eve of battle of thousands of the pagan peasant
soldiers, but we may suspect that the old warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Germanus was busily engaged as well in drilling and
organizing his motley troops. His generalship
appears to have been very good; he drew the
enemy into a battle on his own chosen ground.
The British army was stationed in a valley, the
centre in battle array at its head, the wings carefully
concealed, thrown forward along both sides.
To inspirit the new levies, Germanus gave as the
word for the day ‘Alleluia.’</p>

<p>The ‘Saxons’ and Picts, presumably in the dense
column formation common to barbarians, pushed
boldly up the valley against the British centre, but
when they came to close quarters Germanus let
loose the ambushed wings. With wild shouts of
‘Alleluia! Alleluia!’ the Britons poured down to the
attack, and a complete rout ensued, the barbarians
breaking up and throwing away their arms in panic-stricken
flight. A river lay athwart their line of
retreat, and the passage of this proved as fatal as
the battle. The result appears to have been to
secure the north for a time at least. When next
we get a glimpse of these regions we find a strong
British state taking the offensive against the Picts,
and gaining territory from them; this may very
well have been due to the victory of Germanus.
The battlefield cannot be identified, but it is as
well to warn visitors to Maes Garmon, near Mold,
that this site is an extremely unlikely one. Picts
are not likely to have raided in this direction,
and the English did not appear there for at least
a century and a half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
It is to be inferred from the ‘Vita S. Germani’
that in the south-east at least Britain was still under
Roman civil government. We hear nothing of
kings or even chiefs. Roman official titles are
mentioned, and we are told that the magnates were
richly attired. It is impossible to make anything of
the strange statement in the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle’
that in 418 the Romans in Britain burned their
treasures and fled to Gaul. The Chronicle is far
too late to be of any authority for this period. Its
chronology cannot in any case be depended upon;
but it is just possible that there really was during
this period a migration of some sort, perhaps of non-British
officials and their families. It must not be
forgotten that Britain not only extended northward to
the Forth, but also, perhaps, already had a colony in
Gaul&mdash;the modern Brittany. The ‘Historia Brittonum’
makes the quite credible statement (though
some of the details look rather absurd) that this
settlement was initiated by Magnus Maximus, but,
at any rate, we know from Sidonius Apollinaris that
in 469 it was a very large one. Possibly, the statement
above may refer to some incident connected
with Brittany.</p>

<p>Finally, it is very necessary even to-day to warn
readers against the foolish idea that ‘Romans’ and
Britons were at this date distinct peoples. A
Roman meant during the Imperial period anyone
under the Roman Government possessing civil
rights&mdash;that is, almost all the free population.
A Roman might be by birth a Briton, a Gaul, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Italian, a Greek, an Illyrian, a Jew; and a Briton or
a Greek was neither more nor less a Roman than
an Italian. The average Roman legion rarely contained
Italians, much less inhabitants of the city of
Rome; but, nevertheless, the soldiers were Roman.
So with the civil administration: a Roman Ministry
might contain members of every race under the
Roman rule. Once, again, we must repeat that
men were Roman by virtue of their political status,
and not by reason of their national origin. The
Britons were Romans&mdash;Romano-Hellenic, that is, in
manner and customs, Latin in speech. The Roman
government never definitely abandoned Britain. In
the troubles of the fifth century the province was left,
like many other regions, under local autonomy until
such time as the central government could again
exercise control, and for various reasons this never
occurred. The country almost insensibly drifted
apart from the labouring Roman world, but a
hundred years later its people still called themselves
‘Cives,’ and were proud that they were
Romans.</p>

<p>After the events of 429, it appears that the course
of history somewhat changed. The ‘Alleluia’
victory apparently checked serious foreign invasions,
but there is no reason to doubt that, as
the ‘Historia’ says, Britain was in alarm. The
Roman world was in wild disorder, which must
have affected Britain; but when, in 447, Germanus
once more came to combat Pelagianism, we do not
hear of foreign war. Yet a Gallic chronicle says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
that Britain was conquered by the Saxons in 441,
and Gildas states that in 446 some British provincials
sent a miserable letter, called ‘The groans
of the Britons,’ to the great general Aëtius, who
then upheld the Roman name in Gaul. The latter
statement we can neither accept nor deny. Possibly
it is only one of Gildas’s rhetorical flights; possibly,
if the incident occurred, it referred only to a single
community. The Gallic chronicler may have been
misinformed, or his chronology may be wrong. In
any case, his statement must be rejected. Perhaps
there was a raid in 441, the consequences of
which were exaggerated by those who were responsible
for the report made of it in Gaul. It seems
impossible that, if the English conquest had already
begun in 447, we should hear nothing of it in connection
with the second visit of Germanus.</p>

<p>The only conclusion to which it is possible to
come is that after the ‘Alleluia’ victory Britain,
though more or less harassed by sporadic raids, was
for some years comparatively free from barbarian
attacks.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ENGLISH CONQUEST</span></h2>

<p>Although the English invasion of Britain is by far
the most important of all those which have affected
the island, it is impossible to focus any very clearly
defined picture of the happenings during the long
period of nearly two centuries that followed the
so-called departure of the Romans. The picture is
blurred, but certain strong outlines are conspicuous,
and in this chapter an attempt has been made to
concentrate attention on these salient features.</p>

<p>The incident which led to the English invaders
obtaining a secure foothold in south-east Britain
was probably connected with internal troubles rather
than foreign invasions. The Celtic chieftains of
the south-west were less occupied than their northern
contemporaries in repelling foreign invaders. They
must have cast longing eyes upon the wealthy
Romanized cities, and cherished hopes of bringing
them, or some of them, under their sway. Vortigern,
one of these rulers, probably prince of the
Silures, seems to have partially succeeded in doing
so, and about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 450 appears as supreme over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the south as far as Dover Straits. Whether his
suzerainty extended north of the Thames must be
considered very doubtful.</p>

<p>The ‘Historia Brittonum’ describes the situation
as follows:</p>

<p>‘After the above-said war, the assassination of
their rulers, and the victory of Maximus, who slew
Gratian, <i>and the termination of the Roman power in
Britain, they were in alarm forty years</i>. Vortigern
then reigned in Britain, and in his time the people
had cause of dread, not only from the inroads of the
Picts and Scots, <i>but also from the Romans, and their
apprehensions of Ambrosius</i>.’</p>

<p>The passage is a very confused one, and what
appear to be the significant sentences are italicized.
The opening statement is a kind of summing-up
of the confused sections which precede it. It has
been seriously misunderstood by several authors,
but its meaning is fairly obvious. The chronology
of the ‘Historia’ is its most hopeless feature, but
here it presents no great difficulty. Forty years
after the end of the Roman power, Vortigern
reigned in Britain. As we have seen, direct Roman
rule ended in 410-411. We therefore arrive at the
year 450-451. Bede says that Hengist entered
Britain in the reign of Marcianus and Valentinian
III.&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, after 450; but he is out in his
reckoning, and so makes the date <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 449. Gildas
makes it after 446. Probably it was after 447,
for in that year St. Germanus again came to Britain,
and no foreign troubles are mentioned. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
other hand, the ‘Historia’ says that Vortigern died
while St. Germanus was in the island&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in 447.
This would place the invasion of Kent in 445 or
446, and if it really did occur then, it agrees somewhat
better with the famous letter to Aëtius recorded
by Gildas. But we dare not trust Gildas for anything
before 470, and the ‘Life of St. Germanus’ used by
the compilers of the ‘Historia’ was evidently a very
fanciful work. On the whole the chronology of the
English invasions is very uncertain. The one
definite indication is that Vortigern’s reception of
Hengist took place forty years after the end of
Roman power in Britain.</p>

<p>Vortigern was also in fear of Ambrosius. This
is a most interesting statement. The Ambrosius
here mentioned may very well have been the father
of the greater figure soon to be noticed. The
name is a Latin one, and Ambrosius was almost
certainly the leader of the Romanized inhabitants
as distinct from the Kymry of the West. His family
seems to have been a notable one, for we can hardly
doubt that they are the forbears of the Ambrosius
Aurelianus celebrated by Gildas. Where Ambrosius
had his stronghold is not known; quite
possibly he was in league with London, Verulam,
and other Roman towns, and was perhaps the chief
of their forces.</p>

<p>Finally, Vortigern was afraid of the Romans.
This is probably exactly the state of affairs if he
reigned from about 440 to 450; for the great general
Aëtius was very active in Gaul during this period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and may have sent assistance to the Romanizing
party in Britain. Quite possibly in the letters
mentioned by Gildas the ‘barbarians’ were the
Kymry, and the second visit of St. Germanus may
have been as much political as religious.</p>

<p>However this may be&mdash;and everything during
this period is largely conjecture&mdash;there is no reason
to doubt that Vortigern, whose suzerainty was
evidently a most uneasy one, did, as the ‘Historia’
says, employ German mercenaries under Hengist
and Hors, or Horsa. Very likely he had other
bands in his pay, but the fame of this one has
outshone that of the rest.</p>

<p>Hengist is practically beyond doubt an authentic
historical figure. He is probably to be identified
with the Hengist in the famous poem of Beowulf,
who made a truce with the Frisian slayers of his
lord Hnæf. The custom was for the followers to
die with their lord or avenge him. The fact that
Hengist did neither would be quite enough to
cause his disgrace, and the ‘Historia Brittonum’
distinctly says that he was an exile. It also
appears to bear out the ‘Historia’s’ character of
him as a cunning and low-minded, if able, man.</p>

<p>The followers of Hengist only manned three ships,
and possibly they were in a distressed condition
when Vortigern took them under his protection.
As the small band can hardly have been of much
account by itself, we must suppose either that the
king employed Hengist to raise a mercenary force,
or that when the breach between employers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
employed occurred, the latter were joined by swarms
of adventurers. The ‘Historia’ says that, owing
to Hengist’s persuasions, Vortigern employed in all
fifty-nine ships’ crews. The romantic feature of the
affair, according to the ‘Historia,’ is that Vortigern
fell violently in love with Hengist’s daughter, who
accompanied him, and married her. It was not quite
an honour for the Jutish maiden Hrothwyn (Rowena),
if indeed that was her name, for Vortigern’s amours
were numerous and indiscriminate. She merely
became one of his harem. But if the incident be
true, it is another application of the French proverb,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cherchez la femme!</i> The marriage was certainly
the beginning of woes for Britain.</p>

<p>Vortigern apparently defeated and slew Ambrosius
with the help of his German mercenaries, but then
his troubles began. The Isle of Ruim (Thanet)
had been assigned as the land-recompense of the
mercenaries, but they declared that it was too small.
Bede says that it supported six hundred families in
his day, and as fifty-nine ships’ crews would mean
hardly less than fifteen hundred warriors, the latter
were, from their own point of view, perfectly right.
In any case, they were accustomed to living by their
swords, and presumably believed that Vortigern,
allied to them by marriage, would give way to
pressure exercised by the old and still practised
methods of slaughter and pillage.</p>

<p>At any rate, in 455, if we may trust the ‘Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle,’ the bands of Hengist broke out
of Thanet and began to move westward, ravaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
as they went. Probably at first they did not attack
the walled towns; they may merely have intended
an armed protest. Where Vortigern was or what
he did we cannot say; his sons Vortimer and
Categirn led the opposition to the invaders. A
battle was fought at a place not specified, and
Hengist was driven back into Thanet. Presumably
reinforced from the Continent, he again emerged
from his fastness, and encountered Vortimer in two
battles, both claimed as British victories, but clearly
indecisive. One was on the Durgwentid River
(perhaps either the Stour or Darenth), the other at
Rit-hergabail or Episford, generally supposed to be
Aylesford on the Medway. Horsa and Categirn
were both slain. It was apparently an English
reverse, for the fourth battle was fought by a
Roman monument on the shore of the Channel.
The invaders were defeated and driven on board
their ships; but Vortimer, unfortunately for the
Britons, died soon afterwards, perhaps of wounds
received in the battle. The story goes that he
desired his followers to bury him at the spot where
Hengist had landed&mdash;presumably therefore at Ebbsfleet&mdash;so
that in death he might keep watch over
the country that he had for the moment saved. He
was not obeyed. Geoffrey of Monmouth, who may
perhaps have had some written authority for his
statement, says that he was buried at London.</p>

<p>Vortigern now reappears on the scene, and opens
negotiations with the invaders. The ‘Historia’
says that Hengist arranged a conference and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
banquet of six hundred unarmed notables, three
hundred from each side. He, however, ordered his
own followers to hide knives in their shoes, and
when the feast was in full progress every Jute drew
his dagger upon his helpless British comrade. Vortigern
alone was spared, and, probably in fear of
his life, concluded peace on very disadvantageous
terms. There is no reason to discredit the story,
except the quite inadequate one that the ancestors
of Englishmen could not be guilty of such
treachery.</p>

<p>This catastrophe appears to have ended Vortigern’s
sovereignty in the south, and he fled to his
own Welsh realm. There is a wild legend that
Germanus called down fire from heaven upon him,
but Germanus had died in Gaul some years before.
The motive of the legend is obvious: no fate was
too terrible for the hated dynast who had betrayed
Britain, and the temptation to bring in Germanus
must have been irresistible. Vortigern’s genealogy
appears to have been well known, and his descendants
were ruling in south-east Wales ten generations
later.</p>

<p>Hengist does not ever appear to have lost
Thanet, and in the disorder after Vortigern’s death
he was again able to invade Kent. In 457 he won
a victory at Crayford, and the Britons retreated to
the walls of London; yet in 465, and again in 473,
the invaders are apparently still fighting in Kent.
As the Jutish kingdom never extended far beyond
the bounds of the modern county, there is every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
reason to believe that the conquest of Kent was a
very slow and difficult process.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the successes of Hengist
attracted the notice of his kinsfolk in Germany, and
expeditions, not for purposes of plunder, but for
permanent conquest, were being formed. The
supposition must be put aside that England was
founded as a number of separate states by independent
bands of invaders. That the Britons made
a stern resistance is beyond doubt, and to have
been successful the invaders must have been acting
in large and more or less organized bodies. Moreover,
the invasions were national ones. Kent,
indeed, possibly Sussex, may have been independent
creations by chiefs of bodies of mixed mercenaries,
but the whole English people (Angel-cynn) sooner
or later took part in the settlement. It was a great
national migration, and undoubtedly one of the most
remarkable in history. The emigrants could not
march by land, like the Goths and Franks, in great
masses, which could bear down resistance by sheer
weight of numbers and courage. They had to
transfer themselves over hundreds of miles of sea in
more or less frail open craft, at the mercy of every
gale; yet in the course of a century the name of
Angle had vanished from the Continent, and become
peculiar to Britain. Possibly a remnant of
the people remained behind; to this day a district
of Schleswig bears the name of Angeln.</p>

<p>Bede says that the invaders came from three
nations of Germany, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
This appears to be so far true in that these three
peoples took part in the migration; but while practically
the entire English nation came, they were
accompanied by only a few Saxons and a portion of
the Jutes. It is very probable, also, that fragments
of nearly all the Teutonic tribes on the Continent
were in the invading hosts. The kingdom of Kent is
said to have been Jutish; certainly its social structure
differed remarkably from that of the other English
states, but Hengist himself seems to have been an
Angle. Bede says that the Kentish Code was
written in the <i>English</i> language. The confused
grammatical structure of the present English tongue
certainly points to a mingling of races, and on the
whole we may infer that the invasion was conducted
not only by the Angles, but by many kindred tribes,
and that these latter in course of time gradually
came to regard themselves as English also. Early
mediæval writers use the terms ‘Angle’ and ‘Saxon’
indiscriminately.</p>

<p>The invaders were no mere barbarians. Their
deeds were often barbarous enough, no doubt; but
it must be said that the picture drawn by Bede of
kings like Aethelberht and Eadwine and their followers
shows them in a very favourable light.
Perhaps Bede idealizes; possibly in the course of
a century the invaders had softened somewhat;
but as that century had been passed for the most
part in warfare, the latter conclusion is unlikely.
At any rate, the English brought with them a highly
organized social system, and judging merely from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
recorded facts, they were, as a nation, possessed of
many of the elements of civilization.</p>

<p>Neither were the invaders a mere disorderly
throng of ill-armed and unarmoured marauders.
The evidence of archæology is all to the effect that
they were acquainted with, and used, defensive
armour. Probably only the upper classes wore it,
but as elaborate and costly coats of mail have been
found in graves in Schleswig and Denmark dating
from this period, this deduction cannot be made
without qualification. Mail and weapons, which
latter have been found in thousands, would hardly
be buried, and therefore lost, unless they could be
easily replaced. The chiefs undoubtedly rode to
battle; the deposits are full of horse-trappings. On
the whole, we may imagine the armies which conquered
Britain as being more or less like those of
the Homeric Greeks. The nucleus consisted of the
king and his retinue, with a larger or smaller following
of nobles and their retainers equipped with
mailshirt, helmet, and shield, and armed with sword
and spear. Though they rode to war, they probably,
with few exceptions, fought on foot. Whether their
peasantry were regarded as fighting men is doubtful.
Professor Chadwick thinks that they were not. In
that case the conquest of England was effected by
armies consisting of chiefs with larger or smaller
bands of well-armed followers combined into armies
under kings or generals. Perhaps only when they
had gained a firm foothold in the country did the
English bring over their peasant retainers and serfs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
to till the land, while the fighting men protected
them or carried out further conquests. The frequent
gaps in the war-bands may have been filled up partly
by levies from the peasantry, partly by adventurers
from all sides. Success must have brought many
of the latter to the English standards.</p>

<p>Having said so much, we will proceed to give,
as far as is possible, a sketch of the conquest; but
the reader must be warned that it is largely conjecture.
The skeleton narrative which follows has been
constructed with care, after study and comparison
of the earliest authorities&mdash;Gildas, Nennius, and
Bede, and the few other early mediæval chroniclers
who notice Britain&mdash;but probably there is hardly a
statement which is not open to criticism.</p>

<p>At first the invaders appear to have come rather
as bands of raiders than as conquering armies, but
Gildas implies that some of them, at least, dashed
right across the island to the Irish Sea. His lurid
descriptions of the destruction of towns may be
taken for what they are worth; it is to be noted that
he does not name one of them. He appears to say
that the shrine of St. Alban had been destroyed, but
as it almost certainly lay outside Verulam, it need
not be assumed that the town shared its fate.
As a fact, judging from what occurred on the
Continent, walled towns were able to defy large
hosts of barbarians.</p>

<p>No doubt the raids were destructive enough, and
Gildas, despite his exasperating style, probably does
not overstate the misery in those districts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
were wasted by the marauders. But it is certainly
rash to deduce from his narrative that the whole
of Eastern Britain up to the central watershed,
including all the important Roman towns, was
conquered and ruined within a few years after 450.
The archæological evidence is of the scantiest. The
sites of the greater Roman towns are almost all built
upon. Calleva and Venta Silurum were small places
and of no special importance. The site of Verulam
has scarcely been touched.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that all maps of Britain
at this period are purely conjectural. There is no
real clue as to the lines of advance of the invaders.
The probability is that they made their way inland
along the rivers. After a time the bands are found
coalescing into armies; for this must be the meaning
of Bede’s statement that Aella, whose coming is
placed by the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle’ in 477, was
the first ‘Bretwalda.’ The chronology is, of course,
worthless, but that Aella really did command the
English host for a time is highly probable. His
main sphere of action is said by the Chronicle
to have been Sussex; but probably, commanding
as he did an army whose base was the sea, he had
other fields of operations. His chief exploit is said
to have been the storm of Anderida (Pevensey) in
491, according to the Chronicle, but probably earlier.
He, with his son Cissa, ‘beset Anderida, and slew
all that were therein, nor was there afterwards one
Briton left.’</p>

<p>The Britons, according to Gildas, were for a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
unable to make any effective resistance to the attacks
of their enemies, who were being steadily reinforced
from oversea; but after a weary time of ravage and
defeat, a Roman (Romanized Briton) named Ambrosius
Aurelianus, perhaps a son of the Ambrosius
who had opposed Vortigern, took the lead. The
plan of accepting the suzerainty of Kymric dynasts
for the sake of peace and unity had led to disaster,
and men were ready to rally to one who stood for
Roman traditions. Ambrosius succeeded in organizing
an effective resistance, and the result seems to
have been that he was acknowledged as king in the
south at least. The ‘Historia Brittonum’ states
that Vortigern’s son Pascentius was subject to him,
and in the Welsh traditions he appears as ‘Emrys
Gwledig.’</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the success was only partial. It
appears certain that the Teutons were firmly established
on the eastern coast as well as in Kent and
Sussex. Ambrosius fought against them incessantly
with varying fortune all through his reign, but if
he confined them to the territory which they had
already won, and checked their raids inland, it was
as much as he could do. The invaders’ base was
the sea, and they could attack when and where they
pleased; we do not hear, nor is it probable, that
Ambrosius succeeded in organizing a navy, and no
other means could have definitely checked the
advance. On the other hand, Ambrosius probably
had to some extent the advantage which unity of
command gives, while his opponents’ operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
would often be disunited and erratic. In the midst
of the struggle Ambrosius died.</p>

<p>His gallant efforts appear to have produced important
results. Not only was he able to pass on
his power to his descendants, as Gildas witnesses,
but a more or less united resistance was kept up
against the invaders. In the place of Ambrosius
the cities and kings appear to have chosen as
Commander-in-chief, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dux Bellorum</i>, a certain
Artorius, famed in legend as ‘King Arthur.’ He
may or may not have been the immediate successor
of Aurelianus; perhaps here again Geoffrey of
Monmouth had some authority for interposing a
third figure between the two, though ‘Uther’ looks
suspiciously like a variation of Arthur. Artorius
may have been a relation of Ambrosius.</p>

<p>At any rate, his leadership was signalized by a
long succession of victories. The ‘Historia Brittonum’
gives the rather suspicious round number
of twelve, but as it is obtained by there having been
four battles in the same locality, there is no obvious
reason for doubting it.</p>

<p>The first battle was at the mouth of the river
Gleni; the second, third, fourth, and fifth on the
river Dubglas, in the region Linuis; the sixth on
the river Bassas; the seventh in Celidon Wood.
The eighth was at Gwinnion Castle, and in this fight
it is especially noted that Arthur’s standard was an
image or picture of the Virgin. The ninth battle
was at the City-of-the-Legion, the tenth on the
Ribruit or Tribruit, and the eleventh on a mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
called Agned. The twelfth was at Mount Badon,
and in it Arthur is credited with the slaughter,
single-handed, of nine hundred and sixty Saxons!</p>

<p>Of these twelve engagements the field of the
seventh is practically certain. Coit Celidon must
be the Caledonian Forest (on the upper Forth).
This fixes some of the battles at least as fought
in the north; and this is rendered more probable,
because one recension of the ‘Historia’ says that
the Virgin of Gwinnion was afterwards deposited at
Wedale, near Melrose. The Gleni may be the Glen
in Northumberland. The Dubglas must clearly
have been a most important strategic point if four
battles were fought there.</p>

and north-eastern England. The broken black lines indicate localities now under cultivation, and where, consequently, the
fortifications are no longer obvious.</p></div></div>

<p>If the first batch of battles occurred in the north,
it is fair to assume that they were fought against the
Angles, and this practically fixes them in the north-east.
There is good reason for believing that the
Angles had very early established themselves in this
quarter. Now, it is worthy of note that there is
to-day a streamlet called the Dunglass at the
entrance of Cockburnspath, the pass through the
eastern corner of the Lammermuirs, south-east of
Dunbar, which played an important part in the Great
Civil War over eleven centuries later. Cockburnspath
is just the place at which one might expect
battles between rival forces moving from north to
south and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>. The hills around are still
covered with the remains of fortifications, many
apparently of great antiquity. It may be that the
course of the war in this neighbourhood was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
follows: The English moving south from their
settlements on the Firth of Forth were met and
defeated by Arthur, perhaps on the Glen, and
retreated to Cockburnspath. After a succession of
engagements, they were driven thence, again defeated
on the Bassas (locality unknown), and finally
pursued into the Caledonian Forest.</p>

<p>The seat of war then appears to shift southward.
Gwinnion may have been fought to drive off some
of the invaders who had got into the rear of the
Britons while the latter were fighting at the Forth.
Urbs Legionis is probably in this instance York.
The Ribruit and Agned cannot be identified; Mons
Badonis or Badonicus is supposed to have been Bath,
but there is no reason for this identification; it probably
arose out of the similarity between Badon and
the English appellation of Aquae Sulis. Wadon
Hill, near Avebury, and Badbury (? Baden-burh)
Rings in Dorset have both been identified with this
mysterious site. It seems from Gildas that it was a
fortress. Probably it was besieged by the invaders,
and relieved by Arthur in a battle which stayed
the English advance for many years.</p>

<p class="hang">Showing the probable effects of the Romano-British rally under Ambrosius Aurelianus
and his successors. No towns are indicated within the English areas, as it is
probable that all had been deserted or destroyed.</p></div></div>

<p>The date of these events is doubtful. Gildas, in
a sentence which is the despair of all Latinists,
seems to say that the battle of Mons Badonicus was
fought forty-four years and one month before he
wrote his book. We know that he wrote some
years before the death of King Mælgwn of Gwynedd
(<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 547). This fixes the date of the battle at about
500. The ‘Annales Cambriæ’ put it in 516, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
‘Annales’ are as late as the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.’
Mr. E.&nbsp;B. Nicholson has suggested that the forty-four
years are to be reckoned from the appearance
of Ambrosius to 516. It is quite possible that the
great leader did commence his campaigns about 472,
but Gildas hardly gives us the impression of a man
capable of very accurate chronology. But if he were
born on the day of the battle, as he says, it would be
a simple matter. On the whole, we may reasonably
say that the battle was fought about the year 500,
and its effect was to stay the advance of the English
in the south for at least forty-four years.</p>

<p>One would willingly hear more of the men whose
efforts for a while stayed the flowing English tide;
but practically all that is known is here set down.
The ‘Annales Cambriæ’ state that twenty-one
years after Mons Badonicus Arthur and Medrant
fell in a battle at Camlan. Arthur is repeatedly
mentioned in the bardic poems of Wales, but we
cannot tell to what extent these works may have
been altered in later ages.</p>

<p>Whatever the fate of Arthur, and whatever the
extent and nature of his influence in Britain, his
victories staved off ruin for half a century, but no
longer. The curse of Britain was that there were too
many dynasts for ever warring among themselves.
The picture that Gildas has painted may be highly
coloured, but there is no reason to doubt that when
the danger appeared to be over, the old tribal quarrels
began again. Strathclyde and Reged were divided
among the different branches of the Houses of Coroticus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
and Coel. About 540 the energetic but unscrupulous
and dissolute Mælgwn, King of Gwynedd,
succeeded in getting rid of his related competitors.
He may also have asserted a primacy in the south and
west, for Gildas calls him ‘Insularis Draco’ (Island
Dragon), though it is true that this may simply refer
to the fact that the seat of the Cunedda dynasty was
at Aberffraw in Mona. Gildas overwhelms him
with turgid invective and garbled quotations from
Scripture&mdash;in fact, his so-called history is, on the
face of it, nothing but a sermon directed at Mælgwn.
He also denounces two other Welsh dynasts&mdash;Vortipore
of the Demetæ, and Cuneglass of Powys(?),
and two princes with Latin names&mdash;Constantinus
of Damnonia and Aurelius Caninus. The first
name of the latter suggests that he may have been
one of those degenerate grandsons of Ambrosius
Aurelianus of whom Gildas speaks.</p>

<p>It is in the interval between Mons Badonicus
and 577 that the Saxon Chronicle places the conquest
of Wessex. To discuss this matter in detail
would be to occupy far more space than is here
available, but it may be said, in short, that there is
every reason to believe that the Chronicle’s chronology
is wrong; that it is highly improbable that the
West Saxons ever came up Southampton Water,
the shores of which were occupied by Jutes at an
early date; finally, that Cerdic is a very doubtful
figure. The West Saxons were also, and commonly,
called Gewissæ, ‘the Confederates.’ Cerdic is a Celtic
name; it is, indeed, the same as Coroticus, or Caradoc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and this fact, coupled with the curious name of the
kingdom, suggests that Cerdic may have been a
Celtic prince, who founded a kingdom with the aid
of English mercenaries or allies, and became so
identified with them that his origin was forgotten.
The latest opinion is that Wessex did not start from
Hampshire at all. Some of the battles mentioned&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that with Natan-leod&mdash;may be authentic, but
they were the work of Jutes. Any delimitation of the
territory occupied by the invaders at the time must
necessarily be a very vague one; but it is probable
that when Gildas wrote they fell into three sections.
South of the Thames&mdash;largely south of the Weald&mdash;a
long English-Jutish strip of territory stretched from
Southampton Water to Thanet, never reaching far
inland except in Kent, which was solidly occupied,
and, perhaps, always the wealthiest of the new
States.</p>

<p>North of the Thames indications are even vaguer.
Professor Oman is of opinion that all the Romano-British
cities in Eastern Britain perished very early,
mainly on the authority of Gildas, who appears to
give ‘a picture of a Celtic Britain which does not
extend anywhere towards the east coast.’</p>

<p>To attempt to make any definite geographical
deductions from a writer so vague as Gildas is rash;
as a fact, we know that his five dynasts are only
some of several, and the territory of one of them who
bears the most suggestive name of all is not specified.
Aurelius Caninus may just as well have been king
of London and Verulam as of Glevum, Corinium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
and Aquæ Sulis. Opinion is steadily trending in
the direction of a belief in the continuous existence
of London through the ‘lost’ centuries. This is too
great a question to discuss here, but on practical
military grounds it may be pointed out that London,
strongly fortified, apparently populous, and situated
astride of a great river, was eminently fitted to be
the curb of a barbarian invasion. There is also to
be considered the curious fact that the country round
London was called Middlesex, as if it at one time
formed a sort of buffer between East and West
Saxons. The name certainly seems to show that
London and its territory became English late.</p>

<p>The English north of the Thames possibly lay
north and east of a line drawn from Leicester to the
mouth of the Thames. If so, their abode corresponded
roughly to the later ‘Danelaw.’ They
probably formed, like the Vikings, a confused mingling
of petty kingdoms, earldoms, and the camps of
war bands. What was going on north of the Humber
is not known, but certainly the Bernician Angles in
Lothian were fighting hard with the British kingdoms
of Strathclyde and Reged. Not until 547 did
they take Bamborough. The beginnings of Deira
were probably still later; it is not at all certain that
the English had as yet any footing in Yorkshire.
Had a second Ambrosius Aurelianus or Artorius
arisen to coerce the warring British states into
unity, the English settlements might have been
conquered, as were those of the Danes by Alfred
and Eadward I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
This was not to be. About 540 the Anglian
settlements were fast increasing in strength. The
whole ‘Angel-cynn,’ in fact, were streaming over to
Britain every year as fast as their ships could take
them. Probably they were forced on by the disorder
in Europe, and the pressure caused by the
migrating Slavs and the raiding Avars with their
kindred tribes. At any rate, about 550 we find the
English once more on the move, and this time the
Britons had no Ambrosius or Arthur to save them.</p>

<p>About 547 King Ida of Bernicia took Dinguardi,
soon to be Bebban-burh, and began to push southward
in the teeth of a desperate resistance from
the Britons of Reged under King Dutigern. The
struggle was celebrated in the songs of the great
bards, Talhærn, Aneurin, Taliesin, and Llywarch.
Ida left twelve sons, several of whom reigned after
him. The most celebrated was the fierce raider
Theudric&mdash;‘Flamddwyn,’ the ‘Burner,’ as the
Britons called him. After much fighting, he was
completely defeated by Urien of Reged, and forced
to take refuge on Lindisfarne. But Urien was
murdered by his own jealous kinsfolk in the hour
of victory, and Theudric, reinforced by new Anglian
war bands, was able to take the offensive again. The
murder of Urien seems to have broken the British
power. His son Owen was slain by the ‘Burner,’
and Theudric ranged up and down the country,
wasting it mercilessly, and finally establishing
English Bernicia so strongly that it was never
again in peril (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">circa</i> <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 570).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Meanwhile, in the south, too, about 571, the
English had begun a fresh advance under Ceawlin,
the first authentic king of the Gewissæ or West
Saxons. He probably commanded a large confederate
army collected from all the English states
between Humber and Thames. A great battle
was fought at Bedford. The English were completely
victorious, and conquered the whole of the
south-east Midlands as far as the Thames. The
towns captured are given their English names by
the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,’ which is only to be
expected; by the ninth century their Roman appellations
had vanished. The effect of the victory
would naturally be to leave London isolated.
Possibly it maintained its independence for some
time, but by 596 it was certainly included in Essex
or Kent. Perhaps it had been in alliance with Kent
for some time, for Ceawlin had hostilities with the
young King Aethelberht, and the possession of
London may have been the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">casus belli</i>.</p>

<p>The battle of Bedford firmly established the
kingdom of the Gewissæ, and Ceawlin probably
extended his sway southward to the Weald and the
New Forest. Perhaps it was now that Calleva was
finally abandoned. The confines of the Britons were
narrowed, and the last seats of the old Roman
civilization (if it had not by now entirely disappeared)
were about to fall into the hands of the English.</p>

<p>In 577 Ceawlin went westward, perhaps from
Calleva, with the whole host of the Gewissæ. At
Deorham, probably Derham, north of Bath, he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
a confederate British army under three kings&mdash;Conmail,
Farinmail, and Condidan. The last name
may perhaps be read (Aurelius) Candidianus. The
English victory was complete; the three kings were
slain; Glevum, Corinium, and Aquæ Sulis, together
with the whole valley of the lower Severn, fell into
the hands of the conquerors.</p>

<p>Ceawlin’s later fortune was not equal to that of
his earlier days. He was defeated in an attempt
to penetrate Wales, and his motley host then revolted
and deposed him. The Gewissan state
became subject to Aethelberht of Kent, who now
succeeded to Ceawlin’s position of ‘Bretwalda.’
Nevertheless, Ceawlin had done his work; the
battle of Deorham was the most decisive struggle
in the war which won Britain for the English.</p>

<p>North of the Humber, after the death of Aethelric,
the last of Ida’s sons, Aethelfrith, the son of
Aethelric, became king of Bernicia about 593.
He made himself supreme also over Deira, and
in 603 gained a most complete and decisive victory
over a confederation of Strathclydian and Regedian
Britons, Scots, and Irish from Ulster, under Aedan,
King of the Scots of Dalriada. The result was the
destruction of Reged, which survived only in a few
scattered fragments, and the consolidation of English
power in the north. Then, in 613, the Northumbrian
king advanced upon Deva; a glance at
the map will show his admirable strategy. Bede’s
half-sorrowful praise of him (he was a heathen) was
evidently well deserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Before Deva there gathered for battle Cadwan,
King of Gwynedd, the most powerful of the
Kymric princes; Brochmail, King of Theyrnllwg;
and Selim, perhaps Prince of Powys. Near Deva
lay the great monastery of Bangor Iscoed, with its
2,100 monks; and, after spending three days in
prayer and fasting, 1,200 of the latter accompanied
the Britons to the field. They stood apart, and a
detachment of warriors under Brochmail guarded
them. Aethelfrith watched the gestures and movements
of the strange company, and the sound of
their chants and prayers floated across to him.
‘They bear not arms,’ he said to his chiefs, ‘but
our enemies they be, for their imprecations assail us.
Slay them first.’ The grim order was obeyed.
Brochmail and his followers were put to flight; the
monks were butchered ruthlessly, and then, having
disposed of supernatural enmity, the English turned
to fight their secular adversaries. The battle was
long and desperately contested, and Bede says that
Aethelfrith’s army suffered severely; but it ended
in another great English victory. Two British
kings were slain; Cadwan and Brochmail fled with
only a remnant of their army.</p>

<p>Aethelfrith did not live to complete the conquest
of the north; he died in civil strife four years later.
But the battles of Deorham and Deva ensured the
complete conquest of Britain. The British states
were hopelessly parted from one another, and could
never again combine for resistance, even had they
the will to do so. They were, in 620, as their foes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
had been in 520, cut into disconnected masses.
Worse still, they occupied wild and barren territories,
and the dynastic conditions did not make for
internal peace. Nor did they ever again produce
a really great leader. After Deorham and Deva
there was never any real hope of recovering the
lost ground, and to Ceawlin and Aethelfrith this
result was almost entirely due.</p>

<p>Inadequate and nebulous as this narrative of the
events of a period of such vital importance to the
English nation may appear, yet out of it there stand
forth certain clearly-defined epochs and figures.
The invaders at first only plundered, until an apparently
chance incident opened the way to permanent
settlement. For a time the tide of conquest
and occupation was checked by the series of brilliant
victories gained by Ambrosius and Arthur, but the
civil broils of the Britons prevented any permanent
success over the continually multiplying enemy; and
with the advent of two really great leaders on the
side of the invaders, the older inhabitants found
themselves hopelessly penned up in the barren
regions of the west. Thenceforth Britain was
Britain no longer, but Angle-land&mdash;England.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE VIKING RAVAGES</span></h2>

<p>From 596, the year of the coming of St. Augustine,
to 793, England was practically untroubled by
foreign invasion, except in so far as the raids of the
still independent Kymry come under that heading.
The period was by no means peaceful; the three
great kingdoms&mdash;Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex&mdash;were
frequently at strife, and once or twice the
Welsh interfered with effect in their wars. Wessex
was nearly always torn with intestine war. After 758
the condition of Northumbria was one of chronic
anarchy.</p>

<p>In 793 Mercia, under the great Offa, the friend of
Charles the Great, was the suzerain state of England,
supreme over all the English and Welsh kingdoms
south of the Humber. Northumbria was ruled by
Æthelred, son of Æthelwald (known as ‘Moll’), a
savage tyrant who, however, appears to have been
capable of keeping order, if only by force, in his
anarchic realm. He was in alliance with Offa,
whose daughter Ælflaed he married, and also with
Charles the Great; and his position seemed fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
secure when, in 793, a squadron of pirate-ships
sacked Lindisfarne. Next year the descent was
repeated, and Bede’s monastery at Jarrow was
sacked. The pirate squadron was, however,
shattered by a storm,
and its leader taken and
put to death.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>A VIKING WARRIOR.</p>

<p class="subcap">The details are taken from objects in

<p>The raiders were Scandinavians&mdash;‘Vikings,’<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a>
as
they have come to be
called, from the fact that
their settlements, though
scattered all over the
Baltic region, lay thickest
in the ‘viks’ (fjords),
and especially along the
shores of the great ‘Vik,’
the Skager-Rak and
Christiania Fjord. All
these communities were
ready, on slight pretext,
to take to warfare and
plunder, and leaders were
never wanting. Politics,
economic conditions, and
mere half-savage love of
adventure, all played their part in driving them
seaward; and once the Vikings had tasted plunder,
desire of more soon led them far afield.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> The ‘i’ in Viking is short.</p></div>

<p>The Scandinavians were as yet heathens, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
were to continue so for long centuries. They were
not altogether barbarians, despite the savagery
which appears so terribly in their deeds. Their
social condition was well developed, and they
were not without a tincture of civilized culture
and art. In metal-work their achievements were
notable.</p>

<p>They had long been renowned as boat-builders.
Tacitus especially notes their proficiency in that
science. It does not appear, however, that they
took any part in the Teutonic attacks on the Roman
Empire, but in 515 a Danish chief named Hygelac
raided the coast of Frankland. He was defeated and
slain by Theudebert I.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, the conquest of the Saxons by
Charles the Great which alarmed the Danes into
attacking Christendom. Before 793 scarcely anything
is heard of hostility from them. But Denmark,
bordering on Saxony, naturally became the refuge
of the Saxon chiefs, and was gradually drawn into
the conflict. About 800 King Godfrid took up a
position of open hostility to the new “Roman”
Emperor of the West. In 808 Charles apparently
meditated an invasion of Denmark, and in 810 a
Danish fleet of two hundred sail ravaged Frisia. Two
years later Godfrid prepared to invade the Frankish
Empire, but was assassinated. His successor sued
for terms, and Charles the Great died in peace.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the impulse had been given, and
from 793 onward Viking ravages began to afflict
Europe. For many years they were confined mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to Ireland, which was wasted almost from sea to sea,
the result being, of course, that its brilliant art and
literature were steadily destroyed. The wasters of
Ireland appear to have been chiefly Norwegians;
Denmark was involved in civil war. Frankland, no
doubt, appeared too powerful to annoy with impunity.
England also seemed strong. The raids of 793-794
were directed on anarchic Northumbria.</p>

<p>However, in 834 the Danish civil wars were at
an end. The Danish king was the savage Horik,
‘Fel Christianitatis’&mdash;the Gall of Christianity. In
Frankland the kindly but weak Emperor Ludwig
‘the Pious’ was engaged in civil war with his sons.
In England the Mercian supremacy had come to an
end, and had been succeeded by that of Ecgberht
of Wessex. The opportunity appeared to have
come, and the Danes, backed by adventurers from
all Scandinavia, began a series of terrible ravages in
Western Europe. First, as with the English attacks
on Britain, there were isolated plundering descents;
then larger and better organized expeditions;
finally, great hosts migrating for purposes of settlement.</p>

<p>Such terms as ‘great’ must here be taken in
a relative sense. Scandinavia is to-day the most
thinly-peopled region of Europe; a thousand years
ago its population was far scantier.</p>

<p>The Viking ships were long open boats, raised at
bow and stern, steered by a paddle fastened to the
starboard quarter. They had one mast with a
square sail, but were normally propelled by oars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
In size they varied. At first they were certainly
small, and though excellent in the fjords, were of
little use for rough sea work. Doubtless the
Scandinavian builders soon discovered this, and
began to develop their craft, until they turned out
Olaf Tryggvason’s <i class="shipname">Long Serpent</i>, the wonder of the
North. But the average number of men to each
ship can hardly have exceeded sixty, and it is
doubtful whether the Vikings in England ever
collected more than 10,000 men in one field.</p>

<div id="ip_118" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_140.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>THE OSEBERG DRAGON SHIP.</p>

<p class="subcap">(<i>From the Museum at Christiania.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>The hosts were heterogeneous, unstable, and ill-disciplined,
liable to disown an unlucky or unpopular
chief at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>The Vikings, however, began with at least three
advantages. It is doubtful if the early English
were ever, except from necessity, a maritime people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
In any case, it is clear that in the ninth century
they had almost entirely forgotten the nautical
qualities of their ancestors, and that no English
state possessed warships. The Franks appear to
have allowed such squadrons as Charles the Great
had constructed to check the Danes to decay.</p>

<p>Secondly, neither in England nor Frankland was
there as yet any real sense of national union. The
various English states were jealous and disunited.
Wessex was slow to aid Mercia, and Northumbria,
apart from its anarchic condition, disliked both.
Concerted action was almost an impossibility.
Even more so was this the case in Frankland.
The Vikings, on landing, could generally rely upon
having to meet only the local levies.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the invaders had for a long time at
least an immense tactical superiority. They were
for the most part trained fighting men, physically
powerful, brave, ferocious, thoroughly inured to
war and bloodshed, well equipped with arms
offensive and defensive. The only troops on the
English side equal to them were the ‘thegns’ and
the royal bodyguard, and the Vikings could easily
rout superior numbers of the ill-trained and ill-equipped
country folk.</p>

<p>In 834 the Danes landed at the mouth of the
Rhine and sacked Utrecht and Dorstadt. A detachment
of this fleet ran across to Sheppey and
made a hasty raid. In 836 they again wasted the
delta of the Rhine, and thirty-five ships sailed down
the English Channel to Charmouth, in Dorset.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
King Ecgberht came hastily against them, probably
with only his personal following, and fought a
bloody action. The Danes held their own, but
apparently immediately re-embarked; at any rate,
no more is heard of them. But a repulse inflicted
on the Bretwalda of England by only the crews of
thirty-five ships was an ominous event.</p>

<p>Two years later a Viking fleet touched in
Cornwall. This last remnant of Damnonia had
lately been subjugated by Ecgberht, and at once
joined the invaders against him. The united forces,
however, had scarcely time to unite on Hengestesdune
(Hingston Down), west of the Tamar, when
Ecgberht was upon them. They were entirely
defeated. Cornwall was reconquered, and the old
king returned home in triumph, to die in the
following year.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son Aethelwulf, a
curious counterpart of his contemporary the
Frankish Emperor, Ludwig the Pious&mdash;brave
and just, but weak and over-conscientious, and
cursed, like Ludwig, with undutiful sons and turbulent
vassals. His troubles were soon upon him.
In 840 a Viking fleet appeared on the south coast,
and its land force fought an indecisive action with
Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, near Southampton.
The raiders next landed on Portland,
defeated and slew Aethelhelm, Ealdorman of Dorset,
and sailed away with much booty.</p>

<p>Next year another squadron came into the Wash,
defeated and slew Herebert, Ealdorman of Lindsey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
wasted his territory, and then ravaged the coasts of
East Anglia and Kent.</p>

<p>In 842 a great Viking fleet sailed into the
Channel, and, apparently separating into detachments,
attacked Quentovic in Picardy, London, and
Rochester. These places seem to have ransomed
themselves. In the next year a force landed once
more at Charmouth, and repulsed Aethelwulf as they
had repulsed his father, though, as they left Wessex
alone for four years, it is to be assumed that they
had lost heavily. In 844 a squadron touched
probably in the Humber, and killed Redwulf, King
of unhappy Northumbria.</p>

<p>So far as the Vikings had any settled strategic
plan, it was to seek the point of least resistance.
If they were beaten off in Frankland, they turned
on England, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>. For two years after
844 they were busy in France, and not until 846
are they found again landing in England, this time
at the mouth of the Parret, where they were completely
defeated by an English force, of which the
most conspicuous leader was Ealhstane, the warrior
bishop of Sherborne. It is possible that this
band was composed of Norwegians from Ireland,
for the main body of the Vikings was ravaging in
France.</p>

<p>But in 851 the stress of the attack fell upon
England. First a band landed in Devon, but was set
upon by Ealdorman Ceorl and completely defeated.
A second force attacked Sandwich, and was also
defeated with heavy loss, including that of nine ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
But in the summer the main Viking fleet&mdash;three
hundred and fifty ships under a chief named Rorik&mdash;came
up the Thames. North Kent was wasted, and
Canterbury taken and sacked. The victorious Danes
then pressed up the river to London. Beorhtwulf,
King of Mercia, was posted before
the city, but he was defeated, and
London stormed and sacked. Presumably
its Roman walls were ruinous.
The Vikings, flushed with success,
pushed on to attack Wessex. Aethelwulf
had failed to succour Beorhtwulf
at London, but had now assembled
the army of Wessex, and was advancing
against the invaders. At
Aclea (probably Oakley, near Basingstoke;
see <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>) Northmen
and Englishmen for the first time
encountered in a great battle, and
the Vikings were totally defeated.
The greater part of their army was
destroyed, the survivors fled to their
ships. The fame of the victory went
all over Western Europe, and its
effect in England was to strengthen
the suzerainty of Wessex.</p>

<p>In 853 a Viking force entrenched itself in Thanet
and defeated an attempt of the Kentishmen to dislodge
them, but then abandoned the isle and sailed
to fields where plunder was more easily gained
than among the obstinate Englishmen. But in 854<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
they were again in England, and wintered in
Sheppey; and Aethelwulf chose the next year to
go on pilgrimage to Rome! His son Aethelbald
seized the opportunity to practically oust his father&mdash;not
without some justification in Aethelwulf’s ill-timed
religious enthusiasm. When the king came
back he was content to acknowledge his son as king
in Wessex, keeping only Kent, Sussex, and Essex
for himself. The result of this dissension was, of
course, a serious weakening of the suzerain power
of Wessex.</p>

<p>Aethelwulf died in 858. His successor, the
rebellious Aethelbald, reigned only two and a half
years, and was then succeeded by his brother
Aethelbert, who held the sceptre for six years.
There were sporadic Viking raids at intervals after
855, but it was not until 860 that the danger again
became serious. In that year a large Viking fleet,
under a chief named Vœlund, was bribed to depart
from France by the wretched Charles the Bald, and
forthwith turned its dragon prows towards England.
It sailed up Southampton Water, and its crews
landed and marched upon Winchester. Its walls
were ruinous, and it was taken and sacked; but
immediately afterwards the Vikings were attacked
by the men of Berkshire and Hampshire, under
the Ealdormen Aethelwulf and Osric, and totally
routed. This success of a hurried assemblage of
country-folk shows that the military efficiency of the
Wessex peasants was not to be despised.</p>

<p>For some five years the Northmen left England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
alone, but in 865 a great horde descended on Kent.
An attempt was made to buy them off, and an
armistice was declared, but they broke the truce and
ravaged eastern Kent before assistance could be
brought from Wessex. They then settled down for
the winter in Thanet. Next spring King Aethelbert
died, and was succeeded by his brother
Aethelred I.</p>

<p>The success of 865 had apparently determined
the whole Viking swarm in France to come over to
England. Whether their leaders had any definite
design of settlement it is impossible to ascertain, but
the deliberation of their movements shows that they
were carefully calculated. The people of Wessex
had shown themselves to be warlike and patriotic,
and its kings by no means despicable opponents.
So the ‘Great Army’ poured into East Anglia,
where they desisted from plunder after receiving a
heavy subsidy, but wintered in the unhappy country
and swept up its horses, so as to be able to move
swiftly.</p>

<p>Very early in 867 the ‘Great Army’ swarmed out
of East Anglia and passed through Eastern Mercia
into Northumbria, which was torn between two
claimants to the throne&mdash;Osbeorht and Ælla. The
Northmen poured over the Humber and captured
and sacked York, despite the fact that it was fortified&mdash;perhaps
the walls of the Roman <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">castra</i> had been
patched up. Ælla and Osbeorht thereupon, with
surprising patriotism, came to terms and advanced
together to recover York. The Northmen were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
driven back and forced to shut themselves up in the
city, and the Northumbrians, impetuously pursuing,
became involved in furious street-fighting and met
with hideous disaster. Both kings were slain; the
flower of the army perished in the streets and
during the Viking pursuit; only a remnant escaped.</p>

<p>This annihilating defeat resulted in the destruction
of Northumbria. For some years Deira remained
in a miserable condition, in the power of the Northmen
but not regularly ruled by them. North of the
Tyne, for about ten years, some obscure princes
called themselves kings at Bamborough.</p>

<p>Emboldened by this success, the greatest that any
Viking host had hitherto gained, the ‘Great Army’
next year, under Ingvar and Hubba, sons of Ragnar
Lodbrog, invaded Mercia from Deira and pushed up
the Trent. King Aethelred of Wessex marched to
the relief of his nominal vassal, Burhred of Mercia,
and the two kings confronted the Danes before they
had penetrated beyond Nottingham. It was the
first positive sign of that hearty co-operation between
the states in which lay the only hope of salvation;
but on this occasion it was not very successful. The
Northmen held out stoutly in Nottingham, and finally
in the autumn a truce was concluded by which they
agreed to leave Mercia in the spring if they were
permitted to winter there without molestation.
Whether they received a subsidy is unknown; it is
at least possible.</p>

<p>During 869 the ‘Army’ streamed back to York,
and it was now, perhaps, that they began to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
settling. But their restless and predatory instincts
could not die down quickly, and in 870 the bulk of
the host set forth again, ‘rode over Mercia into
East Anglia, and made their winter quarters at
Thetford.’ The great monasteries of the Fens,
Peterborough, Ely, Crowland, and Bardney, went up
in flames, and Eadmund of East Anglia, taken
prisoner after a vain attempt at resistance, was
murdered in cold blood. Though there is no
authority earlier than Abbo (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">circa</i> 980), the story is
probably true, for shortly afterwards one finds his
memory honoured, and churches raised to him by
the very men who had murdered him, which could
hardly have happened unless they had been deeply
impressed by his heroic end. All East Anglia and
Essex were soon in Danish hands, and the ‘Great
Army’ prepared to advance against Wessex.</p>

<p>Ingvar and Hubba now pass from the scene,
though Hubba reappears for a brief space some
years later. The army that marched upon Wessex
was led by Halfdene, another son of Ragnar, a
second king named Baegsceg, and several jarls&mdash;a
division of command which could hardly make for
efficiency.</p>

<p>The defence of Wessex was in capable hands.
The gallant King Aethelred was admirably assisted
by his brother Alfred,<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> soon to be the greatest of
English kings. Everything possible appears to have
been done to facilitate mobilization, for the Wessex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
men were in the field with the least delay. Better
still, there was no standing on the defensive; the
royal brothers appear determined from the first to
attack their foes and drive them out of the country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C" id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> The name Alfred has become so much a part of English
history that the time-honoured orthography is retained.</p></div>

<p>The Danish army advanced from Thetford to the
Thames, contemptuously ignoring Mercia, and entrenched
itself at Reading in the triangle formed by
the junction of the Kennet with the Thames. The
kings appear to have established this camp while the
jarls began to ravage. But they were quickly to
learn that they could not play the game with
impunity. Three days after their arrival two of the
jarls were attacked by the Berkshire <i>fyrd</i>, under
Ealdorman Aethelwulf, at Englefield Green, in
Windsor Forest, and defeated; one of them was
slain. Four days afterwards the King and Alfred
arrived at Reading unexpectedly with the army of
Wessex. The Northmen were off their guard, and
were driven back within the palisades. But when
the English attempted to storm the camp they were
heavily repulsed, with the loss of the brave Aethelwulf,
and obliged to retreat westward.</p>

<p>The Viking host pursued. The retreat and
pursuit went on for four days, until Aethelred and
Alfred had called in reinforcements sufficient to
enable them to fight again. Somewhere on Aesc-Dune
(Ashdown)&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Berkshire Downs, a
great battle was fought. It is impossible to locate
the field; all that can be said is that it must have
been a long distance west of Reading. The plan of
the battle itself is quite clear, but the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
which preceded it are by no means so. It would
appear that the army of Wessex, coming from the
south or south-east, was halting before breasting the
slopes of Aescdune when the Vikings suddenly
crowned the heights. They were in two masses,
one led by the kings, the other by the jarls. The
English were also in two divisions, commanded
respectively by Aethelred and Alfred. Alfred was
already at the front, and he apparently made up
his mind that it was far better to meet than to await
a downhill charge. He gave the word for the
whole army to advance, and informed his brother,
who was hearing Mass in the rear. Aethelred,
perhaps because he knew that matters were quite
safe in his brother’s hands, and because at the price
of a few minutes’ absence from the field he was quite
ready to enhearten his superstitious followers by a
little pious posing, declined to come until service
was over. The story is probably true. Asser
distinctly says that he had excellent authority for it,
very likely that of Alfred himself.</p>

<p>The English uphill charge had the best effect.
The Vikings were brought to a stand, and the fight
raged furiously on the slopes of Aescdune, the
focus of the fray being a stunted thorn, the only
tree on the hillside. Alfred’s tactical insight had
its reward, and the day went steadily in favour of the
English. King Baegsceg and five jarls were slain,
and the Northmen broke and fled headlong. They
were pursued all night and into the next day, and
Asser says that ‘many thousands’ of them were slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
It is sad to record that this splendid victory had
no results. Halfdene and the surviving jarls succeeded
in reaching Reading, and only a few days
later they were joined by large reinforcements from
the Continent. Thus recruited, Halfdene again
took the offensive, and fourteen days after Aescdune
was able to fight Aethelred at Basing, this time
with success. Still no decisive victory had been
gained, and two months later the armies are found
confronting one another at Marden, near Hungerford.
Evidently the Northmen were still confined
to the neighbourhood of Reading. The army of
Wessex was formed in two divisions as at
Aescdune, and for a great part of the day had
the advantage, but in the end the Northmen were
victorious. Aethelred himself was perhaps mortally
wounded; certainly he died a few days after. His
death would have been an irreparable loss but that
his great brother was at hand to take up his sword.</p>

<p>The Northmen were now advancing into the
heart of Wessex, and so heavy had been the losses
in the campaign that it was a task of exceeding
difficulty to reorganize the army. About a month
after Marden Alfred took up a position at Wilton
with the small force which he had been able to
collect. Says Asser: ‘The Saxons had been worn
out by eight battles in one year against the pagans,
of whom they had slain one king, nine dukes, and
innumerable troops of soldiers.’ Alfred and his
little army made a gallant resistance, and for long
beat back the assaults of their enemies; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
favourite Viking stratagem of a feigned retreat
and a counter-attack turned the day against them.
Defeated, and with the Northmen in the heart of his
ancestral kingdom, Alfred was forced to sue for terms.
The invaders also had suffered very severely, and
were ready to depart for a time to some other more
promising field of plunder. Asser and the Chronicle
merely say that Alfred made peace with the pagans.
We must assume that they were bought off with a
subsidy. The respite could not be a long one&mdash;the
Northmen of the ninth and tenth centuries were
the most perjured of mankind&mdash;but Alfred might
be trusted to turn the interval in the fighting to the
best advantage.</p>

<p>The position of England at the end of 871 could
scarcely have been worse. The results of the lack
of national unity were terribly apparent. Northumbria
and East Anglia had practically disappeared
from the roll of English kingdoms; Mercia was
tottering. Only Wessex had succeeded in retaining
its independence, and was still ready to fight
fiercely for liberty. The situation was similar to
what it had been four centuries before, when the
first assaults of the English, after occupying the
east, were checked by Ambrosius and Artorius.
But while the British leaders left no successors
worthy of them, it was otherwise with Ecgberht
and Aethelwulf. The youngest son of the latter
was to be the greatest and noblest of English
kings, and to pass on his sceptre to successors
worthy of his name.</p>

<span class="subhead">ALFRED AND THE SAVING OF WESSEX</span></h2>

<p>The stubborn resistance of Aethelred and Alfred
had for the moment saved Wessex; but its immediate
effect was to throw the whole force of the
Northmen upon the rest of England. The host
with which Alfred had been contending withdrew to
London, and there it stayed through the winter. A
most remarkable fact is that while there Halfdene
minted coins, bearing his own name indeed, but distinctively
Roman in type. In 873 the unhappy Burhred
of Mercia subsidized the invaders to depart, but,
as usual, they only shifted their quarters. This time
they settled down at Torksey, in Lindsey. A second
tribute induced them to move again, but with grim
humour they now went forward into the very heart
of Mercia and encamped at Repton, near Nottingham.
This finally broke the spirit of Burhred, who,
in despair, fled to Rome, where he died not long
afterwards as a monk. The Danish host thereupon
set up a puppet king of their own, in the
person of Coelwulf, whom the Chronicle calls an
‘unwise king’s thegn,’ and Asser ‘a certain foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
minister.’ With them he concluded a miserable
arrangement, to the effect that when they called
upon him he was to resign to them such of his lands
as they needed to settle upon. So in utter ignominy
the kingdom which had once been the greatest of
the English states dragged out its few remaining
years.</p>

<p>The ‘Great Army’ now separated. One division
under Halfdene went northward to complete the
conquest of Northumbria. He wintered on the
Tyne (875-876), and harried Bernicia, Strathclyde,
and the lands beyond the Forth, now beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
be known as Scotland, from the nationality of its
reigning royal house. In 876 he took up his abode
as king at York. Deira was parcelled out among
the chiefs and warriors, and the Danish kingdom of
York came into being. Bernicia was not annexed;
it paid tribute, but lasted on&mdash;in a miserable fashion
indeed&mdash;under the High-Reeves of Bamborough
until better days arrived.</p>

<p>The rest of the Vikings&mdash;a vast force, says
the Chronicle&mdash;under three war-kings, Guthrum,
Oskytel and Amund, wintered at Cambridge, where
they appear to have been joined by fresh bands from
abroad. Indeed, seeing that there is no record of
Viking ravages either in France or Ireland for some
years after 873, it seems that there was something
like a grand concentration of all the Scandinavian
pirate bands against Wessex. Aethelweard distinctly
states that they had planned their attack in conjunction
with the Viking hosts that were tormenting
Ireland.</p>

<p>For four years Alfred had been unmolested by
the Vikings, and had, beyond doubt, been working
hard at the reorganization of his defences. Probably
his military reforms were on the line of those which
he effected later&mdash;recruiting the thegnhood, the
military class, which was bound to follow the King to
war, improving the arrangements for mobilizing the
<i>land-fyrd</i>, and fortifying the chief towns and strategic
points. But he did more than this. With a farsightedness
which raises him above all early mediæval
Western monarchs, save Charles the Great, he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
that the only sure way to curb the Vikings was to
meet them at sea, and began to build a fleet. Under
the date 875 the Chronicle says: ‘This summer
went Ælfred the King out to sea with an armed
fleet, and fought with seven pirate ships. One he
took, and the others dispersed.’
That obscure sea-skirmish
has a hallowed
interest, for it was the first
victory of the world-conquering
British Navy.</p>

<p>But as yet Alfred’s great
reforms were in their infancy;
his plans were only
traced out, not yet executed.
The flood was rising, and
burst over devoted Wessex
before the barriers which
were to stay it had been
raised.</p>

<p>AN ANGLO-SAXON WEARING
A HELMET OF LEATHER
STRENGTHENED WITH
METAL BANDS.</p></div></div>

<p>As soon as the season
permitted, the ‘Great
Army’ left Cambridge,
made a night march to the
Thames, and crossing it
unopposed, rushed by forced marches across Wessex
to Wareham, in Dorsetshire. It is to be noted
that Winchester was avoided; evidently it had
been fortified since the sack of 860. At Wareham
the Danes were well placed for attacks on
Wessex, and for a junction with their allies from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Ireland, who came up immediately afterwards with a
fleet of 120 ships. But Alfred was as prompt as his
foes, and scarcely had the Vikings effected their
junction when he blockaded Wareham with a large
army. The result was that the Danes could only
effect some sporadic raids of Dorset by sea. They
finally extricated themselves by an act of treachery.
They opened negotiations, and Alfred was ready to
buy them off. Every year of immunity from pillage
gained was to his advantage. The Viking chiefs
swore a peculiarly solemn oath to observe the fact on
a sacred ring or bracelet. Having thus thrown
their enemies off their guard, the whole mounted
part of the host sallied out from their entrenchments,
cut their way through Alfred’s lines, and dashed
through Dorset into Devon. Alfred, leaving part
of his force to continue the blockade, promptly
pursued, and finally besieged his treacherous foes
in Exeter.</p>

<p>We hear nothing all this time of naval operations,
but now Asser appears to imply that an English
squadron assisted in the blockade of Exeter. The
Danes at Wareham embarked early in 877 on the
ships from Ireland in order to join their comrades,
but the fleet was caught in a storm and cast ashore
near Swanage. Scarce a ship escaped, and almost
all the crews were drowned or massacred. The
army in Exeter was now isolated, and late in the
summer, having exhausted its provisions, offered to
treat. ‘They gave him as many and as great
hostages as he demanded, and swore solemn oaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
to observe strictest friendship.’ They retired to
Cirencester.</p>

<p>The wretched Coelwulf II. was now called upon
to surrender his kingdom, according to the ignominious
treaty of 874, and the Northmen proceeded
to settle down. Ultimately they occupied the whole
of Mercia, east of a line extending roughly from
Macclesfield to Oxford; but probably only a
beginning of the settlement was made in this year.
A large portion of the host remained at Cirencester
under Guthrum, and it now, in defiance of its
solemn engagements, concerted a fresh attack on
Alfred with the Vikings of Ireland. A force of the
latter, under Hubba, was in South Wales, and
communication was easy. The levies of Wessex
had dispersed after their long service. Alfred was
keeping his New Year festivities when the stunning
tidings came that the treacherous horde had ‘stolen’
from Cirencester into Wessex, and was entrenching
itself at Chippenham. Defence was impossible.
Raiding bands at once began to burn and waste the
heart out of the astounded peasantry; the foul
treachery and suddenness of the attack made its
success complete. It seemed as if all were lost.
Many districts submitted; many people fled terror-stricken
to France.</p>

<p>Yet it was but for a moment. Amid the panic
and confusion there were brave men who kept their
heads. The King, with his immediate following,
retreated to the Isle of Athelney, in the marshes of
the Parret, and there entrenched himself. His position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
was inaccessible, and he was able to rally the
levies of the neighbourhood, and to commence a
series of counter-attacks on the Danish raiding
columns. Aethelnoth, Ealdorman of Somerset,
succeeded in collecting some more of his country
levies, and entrenched himself in the woods, while
Ealdorman Odda gathered the men of North Devon
at Cynuit, perhaps, as tradition indicates, Kenwith,
or Henniborough (? Cynuit-burh), near Bideford.
In the west, at least, there was no thought of
surrender. The King was able to send out
messengers to summon the <i>fyrd</i>, and though his
position was critical, there is no reason whatever
to believe that he was ever a solitary fugitive.</p>

<p>Still, it must not be forgotten that at this supreme
moment the outlook was very black. Did the
Danes hear of Alfred’s intended mobilization, they
might destroy the shire contingents in detail as they
moved up to the rendezvous at ‘Ecgberht’s Stone,’
by Selwood Forest. As a matter of fact, they
appear to have been in a state of over-confident
security. There is not a sign to indicate that they
attempted to interfere with the concentration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the first blow against the invaders
had been struck. Hubba had duly made his attack.
After ravaging the coast of Devon, he had sat down
before Cynuit with twenty-three ships’ crews. The
place was strong by nature, though ill fortified with
a rough palisade; and Hubba did not care to assault
it, but trusted to a blockade. Odda and his following
did not wait to be starved out. They made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
desperate sortie upon the Viking camp, and gained
a complete victory, slaying 840 or 1,200 men, with
Hubba himself, and capturing the most famous of
the Viking ‘Land-ravager’ standards, a raven banner
that had been embroidered by Ragnar’s three
daughters for their three terrible brothers.</p>

<p>The victors probably then marched to join
the King, and in the seventh week after Easter
Alfred was able to move. The men of Somerset,
Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Dorset, had at last
gathered at ‘Ecgberht’s Stone,’ and now they were
joined by the King amid a scene of wild enthusiasm.
Next day the united army marched to Iglea, near
Warminster, and on the following morning encountered
the Danes, who, hearing of the concentration,
had advanced from Chippenham to Ethandune
(probably Edington). The English were formed in
a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">densa testudo</i>, which, perhaps, means that Alfred
concentrated a heavy column against part of the
enemy’s line. At any rate, his victory was complete;
the Danish army was thoroughly broken.
Its remains took refuge in the camp at Chippenham,
where they were immediately blockaded, and, after
fourteen days of siege, forced by famine to surrender.</p>

<p>Alfred’s terms show how far he rose above his
contemporaries. His beaten foes were to give
hostages, Guthrum and the principal chiefs were to
become Christians, and the army was to leave
Wessex. That the terms were faithfully observed
may be fairly ascribed not to any feeling of moral
obligation on the part of the Northmen, but to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
fact that they had been thoroughly defeated, and to
the influence of the great King’s personality.</p>

<p>So Wessex was safe, for it was probable that the
Vikings would be very slow to attack the gallant
state again. Though a fresh pirate horde arrived at
Fulham in 879 while Guthrum was moving to settle
in East Anglia, their predecessors would not join
with them, and the new-comers returned across the
Channel and attacked Flanders. Guthrum himself
took his Christianity very seriously, and paid special
honour to the name of St. Eadmund; but his kingly
power appears to have been somewhat vague, and
his followers were unruly. Alfred was left in peaceful
possession of his sorely-tried heritage, and set himself
to that wonderful task of reorganization and
civilization, the execution of which is his noblest
title to fame.</p>

<p>The parts of England that still retained independence
were Wessex, Sussex, Kent, and Western
Mercia, the latter under the rule of several ealdormen,
of whom the chief was a certain Aethelred,
who is usually given the quasi-royal title of ‘Lord.’
It is not quite certain, however, whether he did
homage to Alfred until some years later.</p>

<p>Alfred’s domestic reforms need not be more than
mentioned here. His military reorganization included
the enlargement of the thegnhood by
admitting into it prosperous farmers and merchants,
and organization of the <i>fyrd</i>, so that a competent
force could take the field without allowing the
land to fall out of cultivation&mdash;a most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
matter in days when army and people were one.
Fortification was systematically carried out, and
garrisons were provided by a plan which was consciously
or unconsciously based on that of the
Roman military colonies. To each fortress were
attached estates cultivated by military settlers, but
the latter were regularly stationed in the burh, and
probably had their residences there. They constituted
the famous <i>burh-ware</i> (<i>lit.</i> fort-folk), which
played a great part in the defence of England
during the next century. Above all, Alfred steadily
added to his fleet, though it was not until the end of
his reign that it was able to play an important part.</p>

<p>For some years after 878 Alfred remained in
peace, energetically pushing on his reforms, and
drawing closer to Mercia and the distracted Christian
states of Wales, which were beginning to find that
the ‘Saxon’ was better as a friend than the Viking.
The Vikings were ranging about Western Europe,
inflicting upon it the direst misery that it had experienced
since the Roman eagles flew away, but
only once in fourteen years did they attack Alfred.
In 885 a part of their main horde sailed up the
Medway and besieged Rochester. It was gallantly
defended by its <i>burh-ware</i>, and in the midst of the
siege Alfred came up with a strong force and routed
the Vikings, driving them to their ships and capturing
their camp, horses, and baggage.</p>

<p>The effect of the raid, however, had been to
unsettle some of the East Anglian Danes, who had
given the besiegers of Rochester assistance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
English fleet made a retaliatory raid along the
East Anglian coast, and captured sixteen ships at
the mouth of the Stour, but was then defeated. It
was clearly as yet too weak for its work.</p>

<p>Failing to obtain satisfaction from Guthrum or
his jarls, Alfred next year attacked the ‘Danelaw’
by land. After severe fighting, London was retaken,
and south-eastern Mercia overrun as far as
the Lea and Great Ouse. Alfred’s conquests were
definitely confirmed to him next year by a treaty
with Guthrum. The Roman walls of London were
repaired, and the city occupied by a strong military
colony.</p>

<p>The result of these successes was that not only
the Mercians under Ealdorman Aethelred, but also
the princes of Wales, formally paid homage to
Alfred. He strengthened the tie with Mercia by
giving Aethelred his daughter Aethelflaed to wife.
He also placed him in charge of the reconquered
districts, which had been mainly Mercian; but
evidently not for that reason, but as a personal
possession. The English were at last beginning to
draw together. For six years Alfred was able to
pursue his life-work in peace. The East Anglian
Danes observed the treaty of 886; those of Northumbria
also had a Christianized chief, Guthred by
name, who kept the peace with Alfred, and when
the Vikings again attacked him he was well prepared.</p>

<p>In 891 the Northmen were heavily defeated
by Arnulf, King of the East Franks, at Louvain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Thereupon they resolved to turn upon England.
They gathered from all quarters to Boulogne,
and there remained for several months collecting
and building ships. They now, on their short
voyages, carried their horses with them, and had
done so in the raid of 885. In all they mustered
250 ships, and, perhaps, 10,000 men. A second
fleet of eighty ships under Hæsten, the most
famous of the Scandinavian sea-kings, assembled
farther south. The connection between the two
hordes is not clear. Professor Oman suggests that
while their action may have been concerted, it is
possible that the leaders of the larger force held
aloof from Hæsten owing to his selfishness and
greed. The evidence of the campaign that followed
gives the impression that the two forces acted in
concert.</p>

<p>Alfred had also to fear that the settlers of the
Danelaw would join the invaders against him.
Guthrum of East Anglia had died in 890, and the
friendly chief of Deira was associated with a certain
Siegfred who was hostile to Alfred. For the
present the settlers gave hostages to Alfred as a
pledge that they would keep the peace, but they
broke it without scruple when occasion offered.</p>

<p>The ‘Great Army’ landed at Lympne, in Kent,
late in the autumn of 892. It was a bad base of
operations, for it was practically shut off from the
inland by the Andredsweald; but the ports were
now so well defended that a landing-place was
difficult to find. The Danes easily captured an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
earthwork at Appledore which the local peasantry
tried to defend, and, towing their ships up the
harbour, entrenched themselves. ‘Soon after,’ says
the Chronicle, ‘came Hæsten with eighty ships
into the mouth of the Thames, and wrought him
there a work at Middeltun.’</p>

<p>Serious fighting did not begin until the spring of
893. Alfred entrenched himself midway between
the two Viking armies, and soon reduced Hæsten
to straits, perhaps by the aid of a fleet from London.
Hæsten offered to depart and, as a proof of sincerity,
handed over his two sons to be baptized. But with
the usual Viking treachery, he merely transferred
himself to Bemfleet, in Essex. The East Anglian
Danes received him with open arms, and a great
plan of operations was framed. While Hæsten
‘contained’ the English on the Thames, the ‘Great
Army’ was to penetrate across the Weald into
Wessex, sending a detachment with the fleet to
Hæsten. Meanwhile forty Northumbrian Danish
ships were to enter the Bristol Channel, and 100
more, partly Northumbrian, partly East Anglian,
would sail down the east coast and attack Wessex
from the south.</p>

<p>The ‘Great Army’ passed safely through the
Weald, and began to waste eastern Wessex. Alfred
himself seems to have been in the west; but the
English army, under his son Eadward, abandoned
its central position in Kent, and, hurrying through
Surrey, overtook the Vikings at Farnham, and
defeated them with great loss. Their chief ‘king’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
was wounded, and they fled in disorder across the
Thames into Herts, where they took refuge on
Thorney Isle, in the Colne. Eadward followed and
blockaded them; but then, hearing that his father
was coming with fresh forces, allowed his half-starved
county levies to return home. Alfred
was near at hand when he heard that the Anglo-Danish
fleets were attacking Exeter and northern
Devon. Thereupon he turned back, sending only
a detachment to Eadward. With these troops the
prince resumed the blockade, and was soon joined
by Ealdorman Aethelred and the Mercians. The
Vikings then promised to depart, and gave hostages;
but they only dispersed into the Danelaw, and were
soon in arms again.</p>

<p>Hæsten at Bemfleet had been joined by the main
Viking fleet, and was wasting Mercia with part of
his force, the rest being left to guard the camp.
Aethelred and Eadward did not waste time in pursuing
him; but turned back to London, gathered up
its <i>burh-ware</i>, and marched against Bemfleet. ‘Then
came the King’s men and defeated the enemy, broke
down the work, took all that was therein&mdash;money,
women, and children&mdash;and brought all to London.’
Hundreds of ships must have been taken, and among
the prisoners were Hæsten’s wife and his two sons.
Hæsten, returning from his raid, found only ruins
at Bemfleet.</p>

<p>He must be credited at least with admirable pertinacity
and courage. He established himself at
Shoebury, and rallied there the broken sections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of the Viking host. Reinforced by East Anglians,
he again made a dash westward, hurrying along
the Thames Valley to the Lower Severn, and then
turning northward. At Buttington, on the Severn,
he was overtaken by the Mercians under Aethelred,
supported by reinforcements brought up from Wessex
by Ealdormen Aethelhelm, and Aethelnoth, and other
troops from Wales. He was defeated and blockaded
in his camp, only escaping to Shoebury after heavy
loss. His hope appears to have been to join the
Northumbrian fleet, but Alfred had relieved Exeter,
and the discomfited squadrons had gone.</p>

<p>However, Shoebury had become the rendezvous
of adventurers from all quarters, and Hæsten, late
in the year, broke out once more. Marching night
and day, he suddenly appeared in the desolate ruins
of Deva, the ‘Chester’ where once Legio Valeria
Victrix had made its home, and entrenched himself
behind its ramparts. The Mercians were too late
to overtake him, and could only waste the neighbourhood
so as to straiten him for food.</p>

<p>The events of the next year, 894, are rather
obscure. Hæsten, forced to evacuate Chester,
wasted North Wales, and finally retreated to Northumbria,
and so back to East Anglia. Evidently
hoping to be safer so, the Danes established a new
camp on Mersey Island, on the Essex coast. Meanwhile
the Northumbrian fleet was at last coming to
Hæsten’s aid. On its way from the west it attacked
Chichester, but was handsomely repulsed, with the
loss of several ships. The main force, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
reached Mersey safely, and late in the year the
whole host proceeded up the Thames and entrenched
itself twenty miles up the Lea. One hears nothing
of Alfred or the main English army all the year.
It is possible that the King was trying to coerce
the Northumbrians, and there is a terribly confused
and probably misdated entry in Aethelweard’s
Chronicle which seems to point to something of
the kind.</p>

<p>The winter of 894-895 passed away with the Danes
and the Londoners watching each other on the Lea.
So confident were the latter, that early in 895 they,
with ‘other folk,’ marched to attack the camp.
They were repulsed with loss, including that of four
royal thegns. Still, however, the Danes dared not
advance on London, and the English were able to
cultivate the fields as usual. In the summer Alfred
himself with the main English army encamped close
to the city, and under his protection the harvest was
safely gathered in. Forts were constructed some
distance below the Danish camp and the Lea blocked
with stockades. The enemy thereupon broke
away northward, pursued by the English mounted
troops, while the Londoners, for the second time,
triumphantly towed a captured fleet into the Pool.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the retreating Danes had made a last
dash into north-western Mercia, and entrenched
themselves at Quatbridge-on-Severn. There they
remained practically blockaded until the winter.
The English army then, unable to maintain itself
longer, dispersed; but the Danes were half starved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and wholly dispirited, and in the spring of 896,
when Alfred began to assemble the host to make
an end of them, they broke up and scattered, some
to the Danelaw: others who were penniless and
desperate hired or built ships and went back to
France. Alfred’s victory was of far more than local
importance. The Vikings had tried their fortune
within a few years on both sides of the Channel, and
both times had been beaten. The dogged resistance
of Alfred had fairly broken up their main host, and
it does not appear that so formidable a force was
ever again collected by them.</p>

<p>Alfred’s last years were comparatively peaceful.
Small pirate squadrons, however, continued to
annoy the coast of Wessex, and to cope with them
he made great additions to his infant navy, employing
in the work members of seafaring Frisians to
train his crews. The new ships, however, appear
to have been of his own designing&mdash;another instance
of his wonderful versatility. The chronicler
definitely states that they were built ‘as he [Alfred]
himself thought they might be most serviceable.’
They were twice as long as the old vessels, swifter,
steadier sea-boats, of higher free-board, and with
sixty oars or more in addition to their sails. In 897
nine of the new ships fought in action with six
Viking vessels in a Devonshire estuary, of which the
Chronicle gives what almost reads like the official
account.</p>

<p class="subcap">The ‘Burhs’ of Alfred and Eadward I. are shown as squares with a dot in the centre.</p></div></div>

<p>Three of the Viking vessels were at anchor, the
others beached higher up the inlet. Two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
three anchored vessels were immediately taken; the
third escaped, but with only five sorely wounded
men surviving out of her crew. Meanwhile the tide
was ebbing, and seems to have compelled six of the
English vessels to stand farther off the shore, leaving
the other three aground in the rapidly retreating
waves. The Danes on shore waded through
shallow water and made desperate attempts to board
the stranded ships. Lucomon, a royal reeve (perhaps
the commodore of the squadron), was slain, and
with him Æthelfrith, one of the King’s herdsmen,
three Frisian officers, and sixty-two seamen; but
they accounted for one hundred and twenty Danes,
and the Viking ships escaped only because the
returning tide floated their light craft before the
heavier English vessels. Only one of the three
Danish vessels succeeded in reaching East Anglia,
the other two went ashore on the coast of Sussex,
and their crews were captured and hanged at
Winchester, by order of the usually so merciful
King.</p>

<p>The great King had now completed his gigantic
task. He had welded together the unconquered
half of England so firmly that there was no fear
that the Vikings would overpower its united force.
During his reign of over twenty-eight years he was,
to a very large extent, occupied in resisting, and
in organizing resistance to, the invaders. The success
that attended his operations was emphatically
due to his fine character, his capacity for organization,
his steady concentration on the work of uniting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
England against the common foe, and his clear-sighted
vision that saw the necessity of being able
to attack by sea as well as on land; and over and
above all these qualities, his power of inspiring men
with something of his own exalted ideals. On
October 26, 900, he died; probably the greatest,
beyond doubt the best and noblest, monarch who
has reigned over England.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CONQUEST OF THE DANELAW</span></h2>

<p>Alfred’s death left Wessex and western Mercia
still faced by a mass of more or less hostile Danish
settlers in the Danelaw and Deira, but fairly well
knit together by the consciousness of sufferings
endured and victories gained in conjunction, and
with a growing sense of national unity. At first it
is doubtful whether Eadward I. intended to subjugate
the Danelaw; but he was quickly made
aware that there was hardly any alternative. His
cousin Aethelwald, son of Aethelred I., who had
been passed over on account of his youth in favour
of Alfred, and conceived himself to have a better
title to the throne than Eadward, rose in revolt, and
was supported by the Danish settlers.</p>

<p>Aethelwald succeeded in establishing himself as
King of York, and invaded Mercia with a Danish
army. Eadward promptly retaliated by invading
East Anglia; this was precisely the plan laid down
by ‘Byzantine’ tacticians for checking Saracen
raids from Syria. It succeeded admirably&mdash;the
Danes hurried back from Mercia to save their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
homes. By accident they came upon the Kentish
troops isolated, and after a furious engagement
gained a Pyrrhic success. Nearly every man of
note on both sides fell, including, on the Danish
side, both the English claimant and Eric, King of
East Anglia. There was, perhaps, more indecisive
fighting, but in 903 a treaty was made with
Guthrum II. of East Anglia on the basis of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo ante</i>. For six years thereafter there
was peace throughout England, except in anarchic
Northumbria, which appears to have been a sort
of dumping-ground for everything that was restless
and unsettled in north-western Europe.</p>

<p>In 910 the Danes, perhaps goaded into action by
restless spirits from the Continent, again raided
Mercia. Eadward apparently decided to repeat his
strategy of 902, and collected a large army and a
fleet of 100 ships in Kent, but the distress
of the Mercians forced him to hasten to their aid.
Having effected a junction with the Mercian forces,
he intercepted the Danes as they returned from the
Severn Valley, into which they had penetrated, and
near Totanhael (Tottenhall), in Staffordshire, inflicted
on them a heavy defeat. Three ‘kings,’ two jarls,
and seven höldrs, or great landowners, fell, and the
pillaging propensities of the settlers of the Danelaw
received a rude check.</p>

<p>Aethelred, the ‘Lord’ of Mercia, died in the same
year; but his widow, Aethelflæd, the sister of
Eadward, took up his task with energy. Aethelflæd
is one of the most remarkable figures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
English history. She was not only an administrator,
but a strategist and military organizer&mdash;a
combination almost without parallel in a woman.
How deeply her extraordinary qualities had impressed
her contemporaries is shown by the fact
that upon her husband’s death she succeeded quietly
to the exercise of his power. It is tantalizing that
more is not told of Aethelflæd, but even in the dry
and scanty notices of the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle’
she stands out as a great ruler, the worthy daughter
of her heroic father.</p>

<p>Aethelflæd’s capacity was soon to be displayed.
The weakness of Mercia as compared with Wessex
during the Danish wars lay in its lack of fortresses.
It will have been noted that all Hæsten’s raids were
directed against it, obviously because there was
little fear of being obstructed, as in Wessex, by
thickly placed <i>burhs</i>, and attacked by the warlike
and energetic <i>burh-ware</i>. Aethelred had evidently
made some steps to remedy the deficiency of
fortified places, and in 907 he repaired and occupied
Deva, thenceforward to be pre-eminently the
‘Chester’ of England. Probably, however, the
comparative poverty of Mercia retarded the systematic
fortification of the towns, but now Aethelflæd
took up the scheme with energy. In the preceding
year she and her husband had built a <i>burh</i> at
Bromesberrow, between Hereford and Tewkesbury,
and in 911 she fortified Scargate (site doubtful)
and Bridgenorth. Meanwhile Eadward fortified
Hertford, conquered southern Essex, and fortified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Maldon and Witham as advance posts against
Colchester. So discouraged were the Danes that
they sued for peace, but almost immediately
broke it.</p>

<p>After Easter, in 912, the jarls of Northampton
and Leicester raided Mercia. They wasted the
country about Hocneratun (? Hook Norton), but
were repulsed at Lygton (Leighton Buzzard).
Aethelflæd guarded against further attacks by
fortifying Tamworth and Stafford.</p>

<p>The Danes of England now summoned to their
help some of the Vikings on the Continent, and a
fleet under two jarls, Ohthere and Hroald, came
‘over hither south from the Lidwiccians’ (<i>i.e.</i>,
Brittany), and sailed up the Bristol Channel. They,
as usual, shunned Wessex, where the watchful
Eadward was guarding the coast with an army;
but wasted South Wales, and captured Cimelauc,
Bishop of Llandaff, whom Eadward ransomed for
forty pounds of silver. They then pushed on to
raid Mercia, but were quickly attacked by the
levies of Hereford and Gloucester, and defeated,
Jarl Hroald being slain. ‘And they drove them
into a park, and beset them there without until they
gave them hostages that they would depart from
the realm of King Eadward.’ The fleet made two
ineffectual raids at Watchet and Porlock, both of
which were repulsed with slaughter; and after lying
at Bradanrelice (Flat Holm) until its crews were
wasting away with famine, retreated first to the
Welsh coast and then to Ireland. The energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
King at once hastened eastward and besieged
Bedford, which surrendered after a month’s blockade;
while the Lady of Mercia kept watch on Northumbria,
and fortified Eddisburh and Warwick.</p>

<p>The not very effective intervention of the fleet of
Ohthere and Hroald was the last attack on Wessex
by Vikings from the Continent. Thenceforward
Eadward and Aethelflæd were able to push forward
the conquest of the Danelaw with little interference.
During the next three years they steadily fortified,
and practically shut up the Danelaw in a line of
<i>burhs</i>. In 916 they made a great combined advance.
Guthrum II., King of East Anglia, attempted to
stem the attack by establishing a base on English
soil at Tempsford, at the junction of the Great Ouse
and the Ivel, while the jarls of Leicester and
Northampton made a raid on the neighbourhood
of Aylesbury. The counter-attack was a hopeless
failure. Aethelflæd stormed Derby after a furious
resistance, while Guthrum in vain attacked Bedford
and Wiggingamere, and had to retreat on Tempsford,
only to be assailed there by an English army
of <i>burh-ware</i> from all the eastern fortresses. ‘They
beset the burh and fought against it until they
broke into it, and slew the King and Earl Toglos,
and Earl Manna his son, and his brother, and all
them that were therein, and would defend themselves,
and they took the others and all that was
therein.’ Eadward followed up the victory with
energy. Though it was ‘in harvest,’ every available
man in Kent and Surrey crossed the Thames,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
joined the men of Essex and the stormers of
Tempsford, and marched upon Colchester. ‘They
took it, and slew all the garrison, and seized all that
was therein, except those men who fled away therefrom
over the wall.’</p>

<p>The last hope for the independence of the Danes
of England lay in a Viking fleet which had just
appeared on the East Anglian coast. Its crews
landed, rallied the broken levies of their kinsmen,
and, in conjunction with them, besieged
Maldon. Before they could complete their cordon,
a strong body of English troops, probably part of
the victors of Tempsford and Colchester, entered
the <i>burh</i>, and the combined force made a sortie,
repulsed the besiegers, and, by a vigorous pursuit,
completely broke them. It was the beginning of
the end. No time was given for the broken foe to
recover. Late as was the season, Eadward kept the
field; from every county the <i>land-fyrd</i> and <i>burh-ware</i>
marched in hot haste to reinforce or relieve the army
in Essex. Northampton, Huntingdon, and Cambridge
surrendered, and with them all East Anglia.</p>

<p>This was practically the end of the independence
of the Danelaw. Next year, 917, brother and sister
made their last advance together, and captured
Leicester and Stamford, and on June 12 Aethelflæd
died. She had been her brother’s right hand,
and so well had she performed her part that little
now remained to be done. By 919 Eadward had
consolidated his rule as far as the Humber, had
occupied and secured southern Lancashire, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
received homage from Regnald, the Danish ruler
of Deira; Ealdred, the English chief of Bernicia;
Constantine III., King of Scotland; and Donald,
King of Strathclyde. Ealdred’s submission was
natural; the more shadowy allegiance of Constantine
and Donald was obviously prompted by fear of
the Vikings, whose settlements in Scotland included
all the northern and western islands, and much of
the adjacent mainland. When Eadward ‘the Elder’
died in 824 his supremacy over Britain was such as
no monarch had yet enjoyed, and his power passed
undiminished to his son Aethelstan.</p>

<p>Aethelstan’s reign passed by largely in peace
chequered by rebellions which were quickly suppressed.
Aethelstan rather prematurely annexed
Deira, deposing its Danish vassal king; but he was
strong enough to keep down the turbulent Danes of
Northumbria. He had more difficulty with Constantine
of Scotland, who soon began to regret the
engagement into which he had entered with the
English ‘Basileus’ of all Britain. In 933 he threw
off his allegiance; but Aethelstan proceeded northward
with an army and fleet, marched through
eastern Scotland to Dunnottar, and brought him to
temporary submission. He was not cowed, however,
and proceeded to organize underhand a great
confederacy, which had as its object the destruction
of the power of the overshadowing <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dispensator
regni totius Britanniæ</i>. His chief motive for this
action was probably that he was hindered in his
designs of absorbing Strathclyde and Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Bernicia; but common fear of the now mighty
English power had more than anything to do with
the formation of the heterogeneous alliance, which
included not only Scotland and Strathclyde, and
probably the Galloway Picts, no less than those of
the North, but Anlaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin,
Anlaf Quaran, claimant to the Danish crown of
York, and three more Viking sea-kings, with a great
host of warriors.</p>

<p>The allied host gathered at Brunanburh, or
Brunanwerc, a place the site of which is absolutely
unknown. It must have been on the west or north-west
of England, and, since a great part of the allied
host consisted of Irish Vikings, probably on or near
the coast. Professor Hodgkin, with whom Professor
Oman agrees, is inclined to place it at Birrens, near
Carlisle. But there is also a Bromborough near the
mouth of the Mersey, which might be the Brunanburh
of the Chronicle. Professor Oman’s objection
is that it is too far from the base of the Scots. On
the other hand, it is as good a place of concentration
for the Irish Vikings as Birrens, and, if the Northumbrians
had revolted, as seems probable from the
significant omission of any mention of them in the
‘Song of Brunanburh,’ the Scots and Britons may
have penetrated so far south. In this case the Scots
and Picts would have come through Lothian, joined
the Strathclydians and Galwegians somewhere on
the march, and, passing through Bernicia and
Deira, gathered up the Danes of York, and moved
westward to join the Irish Vikings in the Mersey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Still, it must be admitted that this implies a higher
degree of efficiency than can be supposed to have
existed in the inchoate Picto-Scottish horde. Also,
Constantine seems to have escaped by land, which
would have been difficult had the battle been fought
at Bromborough-in-Wirral. There is not a single
topographical indication in the ‘Song’ to help the
inquirer. Brunanburh may be Birrens and may
be Bromborough&mdash;the probabilities are, perhaps, in
favour of Birrens&mdash;but it is not certain that it is either.</p>

<p>However warily the cunning Constantine&mdash;‘the
hoary warrior,’ ‘the old deceiver’&mdash;had gone to
work, Aethelstan had good intelligence of the coming
storm, and marched northward to meet the allies
with all the forces of Wessex and Mercia, accompanied
by his brother Eadmund. The battle that
followed was the greatest that had been fought since
the English Conquest. Details we have none,
except that the struggle lasted from dawn to sunset,
and that it ended in the destruction of the host
that had gathered to undo the work of Alfred and
his children. If the loss among the leaders be any
criterion, the slaughter was fearful. Constantine
himself escaped, but his son fell, and with him lay
dead Eugenius, King of Strathclyde, three Viking
sea-kings, seven jarls, and numberless crowds of
lesser folk.</p>

<p>The battle of Brunanburh set the seal on the
great task that Alfred had begun and that Eadward I.
and Aethelstan had so well continued. So long as
the House of Ecgberht continued to bring forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
strong rulers, the English Empire held together.
The Danelaw was sometimes troublesome; the
Northumbrians were always turbulent vassals; but
Eadmund I. and his successor, Eadred, coped successfully
with all disturbances, and with the fifteen years’
peaceful reign of Eadgar the ideal of English unity
appeared to have been nearly accomplished. Yet it
was not to be. A long minority, factious magnates,
and a worthless king, were to accomplish between
them what the mighty sea-kings of the ninth century
had failed to achieve. The result of Brunanburh
was to establish the ‘Empire of the English,’ and to
awe foreign enemies for forty years and no more.
Yet few battles of that age were so decisive, and it
made a tremendous impression in Europe. Henry
the Fowler of Germany requested the hand of the
English king’s sister for his son Otto, soon to add
fresh lustre to the name of Roman Emperor of the
West; and Aethelstan eventually became the
brother-in-law of nearly all the monarchs of Western
Europe. He also seems to have been in alliance
with the famous Harald Harfaagr of Norway, who
was working hard at the Sisyphean task of reducing
his wild realm to some kind of peace and order.
And yet it must regretfully be owned that we know
hardly anything of one of the greatest and most
successful of English <span class="locked">kings&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Men who had seen the famous triumphal procession
on the Dee in 973, when Eadgar the Peaceful, rowed
by eight vassal princes, passed in his boat by the
venerable walls of the ‘Chester’ of Valeria Victrix,
must have groaned in spirit at the wretchedness that
overwhelmed England in the reign of his worthless
son, Aethelred ‘the Redeless.’<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_D" id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> Aethelred is popularly known as ‘the Unready,’ but the
Anglo-Saxon word <i>rede</i> means ‘counsel’ or ‘advice,’ and a
better rendering of the king’s nickname is ‘ill-counselled’ or
‘wrong-headed.’</p></div>

<p>The story of how Aethelred’s evil mother,
Aelfthryth, contrived the murder of her stepson,
Eadward II., ‘the Martyr,’ at Corfe is well known.
He himself was at the time only ten years of
age. For several years the kingdom was probably
governed by his mother and her supporters, but
they were not strong enough to oust the officials
of Eadgar and Eadward II. The minority of the
king left the rival ealdormen and reeves ill-controlled,
and there is some reason to think that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
monachizing religious policy of Eadgar and St.
Dunstan was greatly resented. At all events,
there was much internal disorder; it is even possible
that a state of modified civil war prevailed.
Externally the country appeared great and powerful.
Aethelred II. at his accession was overlord of all
Britain no less than his father. England possessed
a navy as strong in numbers as the largest Viking
fleet that had ever assailed the country. Yet when
the crisis came everything was in hopeless disorder.
It was not the people, but the ruling class that was
in fault. The exasperation of the nation glows
fiercely through the bitter entries of the ‘Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle,’ whose compiler is thoroughly
aware that sheer ineptitude, if not absolute treachery,
was the cause of the national disasters.</p>

<p>Of the wretched monarch at whose door the blame
for the downfall of the first ‘English Empire’ is
usually laid little can be said that is favourable.
Aethelred II. is condemned for all time by the
scathing epithet bestowed upon him of ‘redeless.’
He was not altogether devoid of courage and enterprise,
but his instability and utter incapacity to
adopt and execute any sensible plan of action were
his bane.</p>

<p>In 980, after more than forty years of immunity,
the shores of England were once more troubled by
Vikings. Pirate squadrons raided Thanet, and the
country round Southampton and Chester. Next
year another, or the same force&mdash;apparently from
Ireland&mdash;sacked St. Petrocstow (Padstow), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
wasted on both shores of the Bristol Channel; and
in 982 three pirate vessels touched at Portland for
a hurried raid.</p>

<p>For five or six years thereafter nothing is heard
of Vikings; but there was certainly unrest among
the English nobles, and when the raids began again
the country was utterly unprepared. Once again
was repeated the weary tale of the ninth century&mdash;raids,
growing ever more murderous and widespread,
and met only by local resistance. But
besides this there is the foul record of combined
action repeatedly frustrated by jealousy, ineptitude,
or treachery, and of frequent buying off after the
invaders had done as much mischief as possible.
In 988 there was another petty raid of Irish Vikings;
and in the same year the great Archbishop Dunstan
died, taken away betimes from the wrath to come.</p>

<p>At this period the famous Olaf Tryggvason,
debarred from his ancestral Norway, which was
held against him by Jarl Haakon, was roving about
the Northern Seas. He appeared in English waters
in 991 with, perhaps, fifty ships, sacked Ipswich,
and, sailing down the coast, landed his followers at
Maldon. He was gallantly opposed by Brihtnoth,
Ealdorman of Essex; but, after a hard struggle,
the day went against the English, Brihtnoth himself
being slain. It was a mere local defeat, like that of
Charmouth in 836; but the consequences were most
disgraceful. ‘In this same year,’ says the Chronicle,
‘it was decreed that tribute should be given to the
Danish men for the great terror they occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
by the seacoast; and that first [payment] was ten
thousand pounds. The first who advised this was
Archbishop Sigeric.’</p>

<p>Next year an attempt was made to collect a great
fleet at London in order to ‘entrap the army from
without.’ According to the Chronicle, Ealdorman
Aelfric, one of the admirals, deliberately betrayed
the plan of campaign to the enemy, and then deserted
his fleet. Olaf escaped with the loss of only one
ship, and shortly afterwards was able to fight an
indecisive action with the squadrons of London and
East Anglia. The English flagship was taken; but,
as far as we can see, the Vikings had the worst of
it, and withdrew northward. In 993, however, they
had recruited sufficiently to sack Bamborough, and
then entered the Humber. ‘They did much evil,
both in Lindsey and Northumbria. There was collected
a great force; but when the armies were to
engage, then the leaders first commenced the flight&mdash;namely,
Fræna and Godwin and Frithgist.’ Two
at least of the three bear Scandinavian names, and
the suspicion must be strong that they deliberately
deserted their men.</p>

<p>In 994 Olaf was joined by Sweyn Haraldson,
‘Fork-beard,’ King of Denmark. He had been
expelled from his kingdom by the Swedes, and
compelled to take to the sea. He had been
baptized as a Christian with his father, but had
apostatized, and had an apostate’s rancour against
his former religion. The two fleets counted ninety-four
ships, and Olaf and Sweyn determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
attack London. They were stoutly repulsed with
great loss, though Olaf is said to have succeeded in
breaking the bridge. The Vikings withdrew to the
Channel, landed on the south coast, and horsing
themselves in the old fashion, rode over Kent,
Sussex, and Hampshire, committing ‘unspeakable
evil.’ Again the shameful expedient of 991 was
repeated, and the host was bought off with a
tribute of 16,000 pounds of silver. The Vikings
wintered at Southampton, and Olaf, who had been
already converted to Christianity, visited Aethelred
at Andover, was ‘received at episcopal hands,’ and
swore that he would not again molest England.
Next year he sailed to Norway, and recovered it for
himself. Sweyn also went back to attempt to regain
Denmark. Aethelred’s silver was probably useful to
both. For two years England was free from ravage.</p>

<p>But in 997 a new Viking fleet appeared, and
wasted Devon, Cornwall, and Wales. This time it
was not a half-political enterprise of two dispossessed
princes, but a genuine plundering expedition of the
old type. Next year the Vikings pillaged in Dorset,
Hampshire, and Sussex, without resistance from the
cowardly ealdorman Aelfric, the betrayer of 992.
In 999 they extended their ravages into Kent. An
army and fleet were raised to fight them, but the
generals put off a decision until the force broke up.</p>

<p>In the supposed world-ending year 1000 the
Vikings tried their fortune in Normandy. One of
their leaders, Pallig, husband of Sweyn’s sister
Gunhild, took service with Aethelred, and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
in the Chronicle the surprising entry that the King
took the offensive against the Irish Vikings with a
great fleet and army and devastated Man and
Cumberland.</p>

<p>But in 1001 the ravages again began on the south
coast. The Hampshire levies were beaten by an
advanced force, and the raiders were soon joined by
the fleet which had been attacking Normandy. Jarl
Pallig also deserted to his former comrades. Wiltshire
and Dorset were ravaged, and the local levies
defeated at Penselwood. The Vikings marched,
devastating, along the coast to Southampton Water,
and there the old miserable story was repeated.
The invaders were again bought off with 24,000
pounds of silver. The year was marked by
the famous massacre on St. Brice’s Day, of Danes
settled in England. The fact is undoubted, but the
nature and extent of the slaughter are not known.
It is to be supposed that it affected only the
mercenaries in Aethelred’s service and the stragglers
from the pirate fleets; but it is quite probable that
many innocent persons were involved in it. The
result was, of course, to add a natural exasperation
to the thirst for plunder of the Vikings.</p>

<p>Sweyn ‘Fork-beard’ had established himself in
Denmark. He had also defeated and slain Olaf
Tryggvason at the famous battle of Svöld, and now
controlled Norway. In 1003 he appeared off the
English coast with a large fleet, captured Exeter,
and swept through Devon into Wiltshire. The
cowardly ealdorman Aelfric once more deserted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
troops, and Sweyn sacked Wilton and Sarum, withdrawing
to his fleet unmolested, leaving in his wake
a ghastly trail of smoking villages and farmsteads,
desecrated and ruined churches, the mutilated bodies
of the country-folk, and the immediate prospect of
famine and pestilence. He landed in the following
year in East Anglia, and sacked Norwich and
Thetford, though gallantly opposed by the local
<i>fyrd</i> under Ealdorman Ulfkytel, evidently an Anglo-Dane.
‘If the main force had been there,’ moans
the Chronicle, ‘never had the enemy returned to
their ships ... they never met with worse hand-play
than Ulfkytel brought them.’</p>

<p>Conquest does not appear to have been yet in
Sweyn’s thoughts. In the spring of 1004 he
returned home; but the wretched country, though
free from foes, was stricken with famine during that
year, and in 1006 Sweyn was back again. He
landed at Sandwich, and swept unopposed through
Wessex to Reading, defeated some local troops, and
thence turned back to the sea. Aethelred fled to
Shropshire, and the Witan decided that ‘they must
needs bribe the army with a tribute, though they
were all loth to do it.’ In the spring of 1007
36,000 pounds of silver were paid, and the satiated
Danes retired for two years.</p>

<p>The respite was utilized for an apparently
determined attempt to organize a great fleet. Every
three hundred ‘hides’ of land was assessed at a
ship; each ten hides at a boat, and for every eight
hides a fully equipped soldier was to be furnished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
In 1009 a vast armament assembled at Sandwich,
but to no purpose. Perhaps owing to the treachery
of Eadric Streona, Aethelred’s favourite, at any rate
on account of disgraceful dissension among the
leaders, the huge force broke up. The miserable
story is told at length by the Chronicler, with bitter
denunciation of Eadric.</p>

<p>The Vikings were led this year by Thorkil ‘the
Tall,’ of Jomsborg, a famous Viking settlement on the
Baltic coast of Germany. The beginning of the end
was seen when Kent and Canterbury ransomed themselves
from pillage. The Danes then raided Wessex
as far as Oxford, and laid Essex and Hertfordshire
under contribution, but were stoutly repulsed
in an attack on London. They wintered in Kent,
and, as usual, the wretched King began to contemplate
another payment of tribute. Meanwhile Thorkil
left his quarters in Kent and invaded East Anglia.
Ipswich was sacked, the county levies defeated,
and the countryside wasted ruthlessly. ‘Redeless’
in everything, Aethelred did not open negotiations
until 1011, by which time the raiders were completely
out of hand. They disregarded their nominal
chief Thorkil, and ‘went everywhere in troops,
plundering and slaying our miserable people.’ They
captured Canterbury through the treachery of the
Abbot Aelfmar, and carried off Archbishop Aelfheah
(Alphege), Godwin, Bishop of Rochester, and a
multitude of captives. Not until the spring of
1012 was the huge ‘gafol,’ or ‘Danegeld’&mdash;48,000
pounds of silver&mdash;collected, and a hideous tragedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
marked the final payment. A horde of drunken Danes
dragged Archbishop Aelfheah, who had nobly refused
to ransom himself, before their ‘husting’<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> at Greenwich,
and pelted him to death with the bones of
the beasts which they had devoured. It may be
questioned whether any deed more foul is recorded
in history. And yet the brutality of these semi-savage
destroyers has too frequently been held up to unstinted
admiration. Thorkil himself was innocent
of the Archbishop’s blood, and next day he sent his
body with honour to London. Soon after, oddly
enough&mdash;perhaps the deed had sickened him&mdash;he
entered Aethelred’s service.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E" id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> A Scandinavian word, meaning a general assembly of householders;
here used of an army, and to-day retained in connection
with political elections.</p></div>

<p>The humiliation had been in vain. Sweyn himself
invaded England next year, and now at last the
patience of the people with their incapable king was at
an end. The whole north and east at once submitted
to Sweyn. He then began to waste Wessex, and
Wessex, too, yielded. All England was his almost
without a blow, except London, which held its own ‘in
full fight against him, for therein was King Aethelred
and Thorkil with him.’ But the stout <i>burh-ware</i>
were exasperated by the bad discipline of Thorkil’s
mercenaries, and when they withdrew to Greenwich,
London, too, submitted. Aethelred fled to
Normandy.</p>

<p>Sweyn himself lived only a few weeks, fortunately
for England, for he was little more than a savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
pirate leader. His army, and the English who were
with it, elected as king his son Cnut, but the Witan
of Wessex and Mercia sent to Aethelred&mdash;so hard to
quench was English loyalty!&mdash;‘saying that no lord
was dearer to them than their natural lord, if he
would govern them better than he did before.’ So
at Lent Aethelred came home ‘to his own people,’
and for once acted with vigour. He promptly
marched against Cnut, who was at Gainsborough,
caught him unprepared, and forced him to fly out to
sea. He touched at Sandwich, and in his rage and
disappointment committed the worst of the comparatively
few crimes that stain his memory. He cut off
the noses, hands, and ears of his hostages, put them
ashore, and sailed away to Denmark.</p>

<p>For about a year England was free from invaders,
but not from faction-strife. Money was needed for
Thorkil’s mercenary fleet&mdash;21,000 pounds of silver.
Eadric Streona murdered his personal foes without
hindrance. Finally, the Kings gallant son,
Eadmund, sick of the endless disorder, took up a
position of open hostility to his wretched father.
Aethelred was already sickening to death, and when
Cnut appeared again at Sandwich in the autumn
the army raised to fight him broke up owing to the
treachery of Streona, who deserted to Cnut, with
Jarl Thorkil and his mercenaries. Wessex submitted
to the Danes once more. Aethelred was
carried to faithful London; Eadmund retreated
northward. There he rallied the Anglo-Danish
levies to punish Eadric, and early next year attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
West Mercia; but Cnut marched northward through
the Danelaw upon York, and the Northumbrians,
under Earl Uhtred, hurried back to defend their
homes. Uhtred found the situation so hopeless
that he submitted ‘for need,’ as the Chronicle
pathetically says. But his submission was merely
the signal for his murder&mdash;by the advice of Eadric,
of course. Eadmund took refuge in London with
the remains of his army, and Cnut, leaving Jarl Eric
Haakonson in charge of Northumbria, prepared to
follow him. Eadmund appears to have reached the
faithful city early in April, and on the 16th the
wretched Aethelred died.</p>

<p>The once mighty English Empire was now
restricted to the walls of London, but Eadmund II.
made a splendid effort to recover it. Before ending
this most wearisome and gloomy chapter of this
story of invasion it is pleasant to chronicle one
heroic attempt. Like Poland in the eighteenth
century, the kingdom of Alfred was at least to die
with honour.</p>

<p>Eadmund stayed only a few days in London. Its
gallant inhabitants could be trusted to do their duty
to the last, and the landless king sallied forth to
rally adherents to his scanty following. Scarcely
had he left London when Cnut beleaguered it.
Being unable to force the bridge, he opened a
passage for his ships round the fortifications of
Southwark, probably by largely utilizing the watercourses
in the marsh. The popular impression that
Cnut had with him a corps of engineers capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
carrying out such a formidable undertaking as that
of excavating a ship canal something near a mile
in length is certainly erroneous. It must be remembered
that until quite modern times South
London was liable to be flooded at every high tide,
and it is more than probable that the only pioneering
work imposed upon the Danish warriors consisted
in making short cuts from one reed-grown
watercourse to another, and in clearing a fairway.
Cnut thus brought his lighter vessels above the
bridge and completed the blockade; but the citizens
held out stoutly, hoping for relief from Eadmund.</p>

<p>The King had reached Wessex safely, and the
men of his dynasty’s homeland soon began to rally
to his banner. In June he was able to take the
field and defeat a Danish force at Penselwood.
Cnut sent off in haste an Anglo-Danish army under
Thorkil and the traitor Eadric, but Eadmund defeated
them at Sherston, and marched for London.
He burst through Cnut’s lines into the city and
broke up the siege. Cnut collected his forces on
the south bank of the Thames, but Eadmund, two
days later, slipped away up the river and forced a
passage at Brentford. The Danes, however, though
beaten, were not routed, and the English lost many
men by drowning&mdash;apparently because they had
scattered to plunder. The Danes still threatened
London, but Eadmund’s victories were attracting to
him large reinforcements, and he was soon so strong
that Cnut finally abandoned the siege and retreated
to the mouth of the Orwell. Having collected provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
by systematic ravage, he transferred his
base of operations to the Medway; but Eadmund,
who was north of London, promptly crossed the
Thames at Brentford and met him at Otford.
For the fifth time he gained the day, and Cnut was
driven back into Sheppey.</p>

  <img src="images/i_197.jpg" width="800" height="547" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE FINAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN EADMUND II. AND CNUT ROUND LONDON.</div></div>

<p>At this moment the double traitor Eadric deserted
Cnut, and made his peace with the far too
magnanimous Eadmund, apparently because he
brought with him his Magesaetan (Hereford and
Shropshire) levies, which had hitherto been aiding
Cnut. The indefatigable Danish king, however,
did not give up the game. He once more transferred
his army into Essex, and when Eadmund
advanced against him he stood to fight at Assandune
(Ashington). He may have counted upon
Eadric’s treachery; it seems impossible that the
abominable desertion that followed had not been
concerted. In the heat of the battle the traitor left
the line and ‘began the flight with the Magesaetas,
and so betrayed his true lord and all the people of
England.’ The result was fearful disaster. The
whole English army was broken and destroyed;
‘all the nobility of the English race was there
undone.’ Eadmund, undaunted still, retreated to
Gloucestershire, and set to work to collect another
army. But he must have been almost in despair,
and it was well for him that the Danes were also
wearied out and ready to come to terms. On the
Isle of Alney, near Deerhurst, the kings met and
concluded a treaty, by which the gallant English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
leader saved a part of his shattered realm, to be, as
he might hope, a base for the future recovery of the
whole. He kept Wessex, East Anglia, and West
Mercia, while Cnut took Northumbria and the old
Mercian ‘Danelaw.’</p>

<p>The reconquest to which Eadmund must have
looked forward was not to be. On November 30
the brave King died at Oxford. Cnut at once put
forward his claim to be his successor, and was
accepted by the Witan without opposition. It must
have been general exhaustion and despair, as well
as lack of leaders, that impelled the decision. Cnut
proved an able and successful ruler, and identified
himself thoroughly with the nation which had
accepted him under compulsion.</p>

<p>The deduction to be made from the melancholy
story of the Danish Conquest is obviously that
national unity was still lacking in England. Neither
was patriotism other than a local feeling. So far
as can be seen, the peasantry simply followed the
magnates, and these latter, with some honourable
exceptions, were clearly, as a class, worthless. A
‘redeless’ king was betrayed by contemptible
and treacherous advisers and nobles, and the ill-compacted
people, without national sentiment, and
with no means of expressing its opinion, was unable
then to redeem the blunders and cowardice of its
nominal leaders.</p>

<p>Between 991 and 1018 the total payments made on account of
‘Danegeld’ amounted to 216,500 pounds of silver, probably
equivalent to £7,000,000 in modern value.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE INVASIONS OF 1066</span></h2>

<p>The passing from the scene of the strangely unsubstantial
and shadowy figure of the sainted Eadward
‘the Confessor’ was the signal for the bursting of
the storm that was to overwhelm Anglo-Saxon
England. For the last thirteen years of his reign
the country had been practically governed by his
great minister, Harold Godwineson, Earl of Wessex.
Harold’s character has suffered much at the hands
of Norman chroniclers; there is no real reason to
think that he was morally worse than most men of
his age. His practical ability was of a high order,
and while administering the realm with success, he
also gave proofs that he possessed tact and moderation.
At the same time, his general success cannot
hide the fact that England lacked political unity; it
was a group of great family earldoms, whose heads
looked upon each other with jealousy and distrust.
Harold seems to have behaved with remarkable
forbearance and friendliness towards the rival house
of Leofric, and though he had more than one opportunity
of aggrandizing his family at their expense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the death of Eadward the Confessor found Eadwine
and Morkere, grandsons of Leofric, still ruling over
his broad lands.</p>

<p>Eadward the Confessor’s fondness for the Normans
among whom he had been brought up was
natural enough, and it is quite possible that the
dominating personality of his cousin, William of
Normandy, on the occasion of his visit in 1051, so
impressed him that he made some sort of promise of
leaving him his heir. At any rate when Harold, in
1064, after his shipwreck in the Channel, became
William’s unwilling guest, the Duke had no scruple
in exacting from him an oath of support. The
decorative adjuncts&mdash;‘holy’ relics, and so forth&mdash;which
he contrived in order to impress the superstitious
bystanders, certainly had the desired effect
on contemporary public opinion. Harold left as a
hostage with William his hapless youngest brother
Wulfnoth, destined to die in captivity.</p>

<p>But when Eadward the Confessor died on January
5, 1066, he, according to the ‘Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle,’ left his realm to Harold. The ‘Vita
Eadwardi’ says much the same. It seems, also,
that the Witan had already chosen Harold, for
he was crowned the next day in the new Abbey
Church of Westminster. It is a curious reflection
that the great church, which was consecrated
as the old king lay dying, was, in a
sense, the funeral monument of early English
times.</p>

<p>Harold was threatened with attack from three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
quarters&mdash;perhaps four. It was certain that William
of Normandy would attempt an invasion at the first
opportunity. Harald Hardrada of Norway, the
last of the great Viking monarchs, was known to
be ready for any opportunity of aggrandizement.
Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark, cousin of Harthacnut,
might deem the moment favourable for advancing
his claims. Finally, Tosti, Harold’s
worthless brother, was preparing to regain by force
his forfeited Northumbrian earldom. Internally,
the Northern earls were lukewarm in Harold’s
cause. They were men of little mark, but they
controlled nearly half England, and their disaffection
was a very serious matter. Truly, says the
Chronicle of Harold, ‘little quiet did he enjoy
while he wielded the kingdom.’</p>

<p>When the news of Harold’s coronation reached
Normandy, William broke out into one of those
terrible bursts of savage rage to which he was subject
in times of stress. ‘To no man spake he, and
none dared speak to him,’ says a chronicler. After
his fit of passion was over he announced his intention
of invading England. He called an assembly
of his barons at Lillebonne on the Seine, and set
forth his ideas, but they hung back; England
seemed too strong. He then appealed to their
individual loyalty, promising to reward them with
English lands in proportion to the contingents that
they furnished, and with this inducement practically
the entire baronage of Normandy agreed to join in
the enterprise. But the forces of Normandy alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
were not strong enough, and William used every
means to induce neighbouring princes and adventurers
to join his standard. Eustace, Count of
Boulogne, who had a private grudge against England,
and Alan Fergent, cousin of the Duke of
Brittany, were the most notable of these foreign
allies; but adventurers from all France came in
numbers, and even, so Guy of Amiens says, some
of the Normans who were conquering Southern
Italy from the Eastern Empire. Many months
were needed before the miscellaneous host could be
gathered, and hundreds of ships had to be built and
launched for the transport of the fighting men,
followers, the provisions, and, above all, the thousands
of horses, without which the mailed knights
would lose three-quarters of their efficiency. Wace
tells us that the number of vessels that actually sailed
was 696; other chroniclers raise it to 3,000. In this
conflict of evidence the figures given by Wace have
a strong appearance of veracity. Most of the vessels
were doubtless small.</p>

<p>The number of the army is stated at from 40,000
to 60,000 by mediæval chroniclers. Some modern
estimates put it as low as 12,000. There are
no solid grounds upon which to base a reasoned
estimate. After the Conquest there were about
4,300 knight’s fiefs in England. The casualties
among the invaders were enormous, but the gaps
were filled by fresh adventurers, and certainly not
all the English landowners were dispossessed. We
are, perhaps, justified in assuming 4,000 cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
about 4,000 archers, and possibly 7,000 mail-clad
infantry&mdash;say 15,000 men in all.</p>

<p>William had the support of religion in his enterprise
in so far as it could be given by a papal bull.
There had been, even under the pious Confessor,
irregularity in the filling up of the episcopal sees;
in particular, the position of Stigand, Archbishop
of Canterbury, was a scandal. This, and Harold’s
perjury, induced the support of Alexander II., and
a consecrated banner was sent to William with
the bull.</p>

<p>The gathering-place of the army of invasion was
at the mouth of the Dive. The Norman writers are
eloquent upon the admirable order and discipline
that prevailed in the camp, and, beyond doubt,
William did keep his own subjects well in hand;
but that the same was the case with the motley
throng of allies is hardly possible. Still, knowing
what manner of man William was, it is likely enough
that his standard of discipline was, for the time, a
very creditable one. Moreover, when the army
came to fight it showed itself to be very different
from the usual disorderly mediæval horde&mdash;highly
trained, flexible, precise in manœuvre, and under
excellent discipline. Its organization was clearly
Byzantine. The three East-Roman arms&mdash;archers,
heavy infantry, and mailed cavalry&mdash;were all
there. An East-Roman army would have had
nearly as many cavalry as infantry, if it had used
infantry at all to back its masses of mail-clad horse-bowmen
and lancers, but William’s resources were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
unequal to putting many thousands of mounted men
in the field. As it is, it is evident that his army
was by far the finest force that had ever invaded
England.</p>

<p>By about August 10 the concentration appears to
have been almost complete, but for a month no
move could be made owing to persistently contrary
winds. The difficulties of supply must have become
greater and greater, and in September William
moved to the Abbey of St. Walaric, now St. Valery,
in Caux. Still for a fortnight longer the favouring
wind did not come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tosti had long since sailed. His
attack was made apparently in conjunction with
Harald Hardrada. He had in Flanders collected
enough miscellaneous adventurers to man sixty
ships, but his impatience&mdash;probably he could not
keep his plundering bands together&mdash;wrecked the
design of co-operation with Hardrada. The Norwegian
king was collecting a great armament, and
probably its concentration took time. At any rate,
he did not appear in English waters until August.</p>

<p>Harold, meanwhile, was organizing for defence.
His only standing force consisted of the Hus-Carles,
or royal household troops&mdash;4,000 men at the
utmost. They were, unquestionably, a magnificent
body of men, fully equal in quality to William’s knighthood,
equipped like them with helmet and mail-shirt,
kite-shaped shield, and armed with the terrible battle-axe,
which England had adopted from Denmark.
Unfortunately, however, though they habitually used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
horses on the march, they had no experience of, or
training in, fighting on horseback&mdash;a fatal defect.</p>

<p>The <i>land fyrd</i>, on the other hand, was difficult to
move. It is easy to under-estimate its value; there
must have been a large number of men in it fully
armed and equipped for war; but they were never
properly drilled and exercised together, and were
mingled with half-armed peasantry. Still, considering
the large numbers of the men liable for service,
it must have been comparatively easy to collect a
considerable force of properly equipped troops, but
it entirely lacked cavalry and archers.</p>

<p>Mediæval feudal armies practically depended for
supplies on plunder, and were consequently always
liable to dissolve. Here and there we find men&mdash;great
generals like William I. and Edward I.&mdash;who
understood how to organize a proper commissariat,
but they were few and far between. Apparently
Harold II. was one of them, for there is no doubt
that he kept a large army together on the south
coast for several months.</p>

<p>The defence of the north was, of course, entrusted
to the earls Eadwine and Morkere; no other course
was possible. Nor, upon the whole, does it seem
that they failed to do their duty. Harold was in
Northumbria early in the year, and no doubt did
his best to conciliate them. Otherwise he seems to
have been very active, and Florence of Worcester
says that his activity was highly beneficial, but
significantly adds that his chief efforts were for the
defence of the country. In April Halley’s Comet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
made one of its recurring appearances, and, needless
to say, was looked upon as the forerunner of coming
evil.</p>

<p>Under the great West Saxon kings, as we have
seen, England possessed an effective navy, but it is
very doubtful whether under Eadward the Confessor
any large force had been kept up. Harold’s
defensive armada must have consisted largely of
levied merchant craft. It collected off the Isle of
Wight&mdash;obviously in Spithead&mdash;and there awaited
the coming of the invaders. The forces of the
south were stationed ‘by the sea’&mdash;presumably in
divisions within easy reach of one another&mdash;and
the King himself with his guards formed a reserve
which could be transferred north or south at will.</p>

<p>The defects of this strategy are obvious enough.
It was solely defensive. No attempt was made to
stop the sailing of the hostile fleets; even Tosti’s
puny armament was allowed to reach England
without molestation. The splendid marching and
fighting feats of the royal guards show that their
efficiency was high. A commissariat sufficient to
supply a large force for several months had
evidently been organized; but all this proved useless
owing to the bad initial strategy of standing
purely on the defensive.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE CAMPAIGN OF 1066.</p>

<p class="subcap">Showing the probable route of Harold’s dash to the north against Harald
Hardrada and Tosti, and his return to face William.</p></div></div>

<p>In May Tosti appeared on the coast of Kent.
Apparently Harold was already on the south coast,
for we are told that he at once moved against
him with a fleet and an army such as no King of
England had ever gathered. Tosti, who had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
plundering descents on the coast and had also
endeavoured to increase his small force by forced
impressment, did not await the onslaught, but fled.
His second descent was made in the Humber.
Earl Eadwine promptly set upon and defeated him;
his miscellaneous force broke up, and Tosti himself
fled northward to Scotland with only twelve
ships. Here he seems to have been sheltered by
Malcolm Canmore; presumably the Scottish king
dared not eject him, when at any moment the
formidable Harald Hardrada might appear.</p>

<p>Harold and William lay watching each other
across the Channel all through the summer. When
William’s host had at last gathered, the wind, as we
have seen, was contrary, and for nearly two months
he could not stir. This was fortunate for him; had
he sailed in August, he would have been attacked
by Harold’s fleet, and his own flotilla, crowded
with troops and thousands of horses, would have
fared badly. Even had the Normans gained the
day they would have hardly been able to land. It
was a trial of endurance. On September 8 the
English fleet had exhausted its stores, and was
forced to return to London to reprovision and refit.
Still the land army remained in the south, but
a week later came the news that Harald Hardrada
was in the Humber.</p>

<p>The consequences of Harold’s purely defensive
strategy now stared him in the face. The fleet
was for the time entirely off the board, but to
concentrate against Hardrada was a vital necessity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Harold marched northward without delay, and
certainly strove to make up for strategic errors by
activity. From Portsmouth to York is over
250 miles, but the distance was covered in ten
days. Obviously Harold’s whole corps must have
been mounted; but even so it was a remarkable
performance.</p>

<p>Hardrada, having picked up Tosti and the
remains of his expedition, proceeded southward
along the coast of Northumbria, landing and
ravaging in the old Viking fashion. Scarborough
was taken and sacked, and the Norwegian fleet
sailed up the Humber and landed its army, which
marched upon York. Eadwine and Morkere had
united their forces, and stood to fight at Fulford,
two miles south of the Northumbrian capital, where
they were attacked by Hardrada on September 20,
and completely defeated. The remains of their
army took refuge in York, and so cowed were the
Northumbrians that they offered 150 hostages as
a pledge of their submission. Hardrada probably
thought himself secure; he withdrew to the Derwent,
seven miles east of York, and was encamped
carelessly on both its banks, about Stamford Bridge,
when on September 25 Harold, having passed
through York, came upon him. No hint of his
approach seems to have preceded him. The speed
and secrecy of the march are alike remarkable.</p>

<p>The attack fell like a thunderbolt on the unprepared
Norwegians. Scattered, astounded, and
without time to form order of battle, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
massacred right and left, and driven towards the
Derwent in a confusion that can only have tended
to grow greater. The bridge was desperately
defended, and under cover of the stand Hardrada’s
personal following seems to have been able to rally
on the ‘Land-ravager’&mdash;the raven standard of the
Vikings. After a series of fierce attacks the shield
ring was broken, Hardrada and Tosti were slain,
and Olaf, the king’s son, surrendered, on promise of
being allowed to depart with the survivors. They
are said to have been able to man only 24 ships of
the original 300. We may suspect exaggeration.</p>

<p>Harold returned in triumph to York, where he
seems to have delayed for a week or so; doubtless
his troops, after their exertions, needed a rest. The
northern levies also must have required reorganization.
In the midst of toils and rejoicings came the
terrible news that William was in Sussex.</p>

<p>On September 27 the long-sought-for south wind
blew at last, and the huge unwieldy Norman fleet
put out from St. Walaric. William’s flagship was
the <i class="shipname">Mora</i>, a gallant vessel given to him by his
wife Matilda. She bore on her stern a gilded
figure of a boy bearing a banner, as the Bayeux
tapestry clearly indicates.</p>

<p class="subcap">On the mast of the <i class="shipname">Mora</i> is shown the lantern which guided the fleet.</p>

<p class="subcap">(<i>From the Bayeux Tapestry.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>From St. Valery-en-Caux to Pevensey is less than
sixty-five miles, and the fact that the flotilla took,
apparently, nearly two days to cover it, gives some
index to its encumbered condition. None the less,
it sailed in something like order, guided by a huge
lantern at the masthead of the <i class="shipname">Mora</i>. On the 28th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
it reached Pevensey, and the disembarkation was
quietly effected. William himself stumbled and fell
on his face as he sprang ashore. A murmur of
dismay rose from the superstition-ridden barons
behind, but he sprang to his feet and showed them
that as he fell he had clutched up the sand with
both hands. ‘See how I have taken possession of
England!’ he cried, and his followers hailed the
omen of good as readily as they had trembled at the
accident. It was one of those incidents that mark
the born leader of men.</p>

<p>From Pevensey William moved to Hastings,
which he occupied without resistance. A palisaded
fort is said to have been constructed; one wonders
why William did not encamp within the splendid
Roman walls of Pevensey. He then began to waste
the coast districts in the neighbourhood, partly perhaps
in order to provoke his rival to an engagement,
but also, probably, in part for purposes of supply.</p>

<p>Wonderful as had been Harold’s march to York, his
rush back to London was yet more so. He covered
the distance of over 190 miles in seven days at the
outside, perhaps in six, an average of 27 or 32 miles
a day! On October 7 he was in London. Eadwine
and Morkere were still far behind. They have been
severely blamed for their slowness; but it is only fair
to point out that their levies had been sorely thinned
at Fulford and Stamford Bridge, and that the collection
and organization of reinforcements can have been
no easy task. If the northern troops started only a
day behind Harold and marched at the very fair rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of eighteen miles a day, they must have still been
some distance from London when he left it for the
south. Probably Eadwine and Morkere failed to
realize the urgency of the crisis; but, on the other
hand, Harold’s precipitancy must have been disconcerting.</p>

<p>The King stayed only some four days in London.
On the 11th he marched again, presumably with
the royal guards and the men of London and the
home counties. He again pressed forward with
great speed; the rate of marching was over eighteen
miles a day. On the afternoon of the 13th the head
of the column was on Senlac Hill, eight miles from
Hastings, and there, no doubt, the King could
question peasants and could ascertain that William
had concentrated his army.</p>

<p>That he had had hopes of repeating his feat at
Stamford Bridge seems almost certain. The authorities
are practically unanimous in stating or implying
that his army would have been strongly reinforced
had he delayed a little, and that he did not do so is
best explained by his anxiety to execute another
surprise attack on an unprepared enemy. As this
plan had obviously failed, it was to his interest to
avoid a battle; and the general opinion at the time
evidently was that he was unwise to risk one. The
story that his brother Gyrth would have dissuaded
him from engaging, but that he declined to look
on while his people were pillaged by the Norman
raiders, may be taken for what it is worth, but it
points to the prevalence of this opinion. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
probable explanation is that the weary and ill-disciplined
army could not be withdrawn in the
darkness from the ridge on which it was bivouacking,
and it was therefore necessary to remain there for
the night. William on his side was obliged to fight.
His army subsisted by pillage, and would starve if
it were forced to remain long in a state of close
concentration. He had early notice of his rival’s
advance, and had his army in hand about Hastings.
He was at Telham so early on the morning of the
14th that to decline a battle was difficult, if not
impossible, for Harold. With disciplined troops a
retreat would have been practicable enough, but it
was not so for the cumbrous English host. Perhaps,
too, Harold overrated the fighting power of his
axemen. In any case, it is clear that he stood to
receive battle when retreat was his wisest strategy.</p>

<p>Senlac Hill is an outlying spur of the South
Downs, roughly parallel to them, and connected
with them by a short saddleback. The main ridge
is about 280 feet above the sea at its culminating
point, and nearly 1,200 yards long. The road from
London passes along the saddleback, over the ridge
towards its eastern end, and across a valley to
Telham Hill, about a mile distant. The slope of
the ridge in front is fairly gentle, but where the
remains of the Abbey now stand it rises steeply to a
commanding knoll. The exact gradient is difficult
to estimate, for when the Abbey was built the slope
was much altered by terracing, which exists to-day.
On both flanks&mdash;especially the left&mdash;and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
rear, except where the road approaches, the slopes
are steep. For over half its length the front face of
the ridge is covered by a brook and a line of ponds.
In 1066 in their place there was most probably a
marsh, almost impassable for cavalry. Even at the
present day the ground just below the ponds
becomes extremely difficult for a horseman. The
western half of the position could probably only
have been assailed by the very dangerous process
of filing horsemen round the end of the marsh, and
advancing them in front of it. This actually appears
to have been attempted by part of the Norman
army; but it was only possible to deliver direct
attacks on a front of about 750 yards. In this
narrow space the deadliest fighting took place.
Behind all was the forest of the Andredsweald.</p>

<p>The strength of the English army can only be
guessed at. According to the earlier writers it was
densely massed along the ridge, but it is probable
that the almost unassailable western end was not
held in force. On the other hand, the eastward
portions were probably very strongly held. There
may have been in all about 15,000 men. About half
the troops were probably fully equipped men, and
in their strong position were capable of beating off
an attack of any other army in Western Europe,
except the one that now faced them. As compared
with it the English, without archers or cavalry, were
at a hopeless disadvantage, but even as it was they
came very near success.</p>

<p>The question of fortification has been often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
discussed. None of the earlier writers mention any,
nor are any shown on the Bayeux tapestry, the
workers of which would very probably have had
William’s own personal account to go upon. Wace
appears to describe a sort of wicker breastwork. So
much is certain, that the English troops reached the
ground too late and too fatigued to be able to carry
out much entrenching work. The cries of ‘Út! Út!’
(Out! Out!), attributed to the English, may perhaps
indicate that they conceived themselves to occupy an
entrenched enclosure; but it may just as well refer
to the impatience of men pent up in the shield-ring
under a storm of arrows.</p>

<p>The Norman army advancing from Hastings
reached Telham early in the morning. An interesting
detail is that the knights rode in their tunics
and did not don their armour until they reached the
field. At the foot of Telham the army deployed in
three divisions, each of three lines classified according
to arms. The front line consisted of archers
and crossbow-men&mdash;there were some of these latter
present; the second of mail-clad infantry; the third
of the cavalry. The right wing consisted mainly of
the French and Flemish mercenaries under Eustace
of Boulogne and the Norman baron Roger de
Montgomerie. On the left were the Breton
Angevin and Aquitanian troops. William himself
was in the centre with his Normans. Ralph de
Toesny, the hereditary standard-bearer of Normandy,
had begged to be allowed to ‘fight with both hands’
on that day; and Walter Giffard de Longueville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
declined to bear the Pope’s banner. He was old,
he said, and would like to do a last good day’s
fighting. So the standard was borne at William’s
side by Toustain de Bec-en-Caux. William himself
bore on this day not the lance, which was still a
light weapon often used for throwing, but a ponderous
iron mace, and with him rode his brothers Odo
of Bayeux and Robert of Mortain.</p>

<p>As the Normans marched down Telham, Senlac
suddenly appeared to be crowned with a dense line
of axes and shields. The English seemed to
spring out of the wood, says Guy of Amiens.
This may indicate that they were taken by surprise,
and hastily faced about to meet the unexpected
approach of the Normans. The royal guards were
on the left centre, with the Dragon of Wessex and
the King’s Warrior banner planted where the altar
of Battle Abbey afterwards rose. With the guards
almost certainly were the Londoners, who were
probably the best equipped troops of the <i>fyrd</i>. They
were under Esegar, the first ‘Staller’ (Marshal).
Everything seems to show that there was a solid mass
of picked troops in the centre. The King, with his
brothers Gyrth and Leofwine, was on foot by his
standards surrounded by his incomparable footguards.</p>

<p>The Norman host advanced across the valley
and began to breast Senlac Hill, the archers shooting
furiously as soon as they came within range.
For a while it was attack without defence, and it
is odd that William does not appear to have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
that the bowmen could be left to prepare the way.
The English could only suffer, and already, perhaps,
impatient warriors were beginning to cry ‘Out!
Out!’ yearning to exchange blows with their exasperating
enemies. The archers, emboldened by
their bloodless progress, pressed forward to close
range, and then came the English reply. The
leading ranks of the Normans were overwhelmed
with a perfect hail of miscellaneous missiles&mdash;spears,
javelins, casting-axes, and stones, some of the
latter tied to clubs and hurled like hammers. The
archers came to a stand, still plying their bows;
and the heavy infantry pushed up between their
intervals and came to handgrips with the English.
Their charge broke vainly upon the shield-wall;
not a gap could the Norman foot-soldiers tear in it.
Javelins, taper-axes, and stone hammers crashed
among them fast and furiously; the great axes
swayed and fell with terrible effect. Do what they
would they could make no progress.</p>

<p>Probably the Norman infantry were already
falling back when William let loose his cavalry.
No doubt the chivalry of France and Normandy
expected to ride down the English infantry with
ease. Out in front of the long moving line of
horsemen, bright in their ringed mail shirts, rode
the minstrel Taillefer, chanting verses from the
‘Song of Roland,’ playing with his sword as he
pricked up the slope. He was the first of the
knighthood to penetrate the shield-wall&mdash;also the
first to fall. The long lines of horsemen crashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
against the shields; the shock must have been
tremendous, but their fortune was no better than
that of their despised infantry. The English front
may have been pressed back, even pierced in
places, but the gaps were at once restored; man
and horse went down beneath the tremendous
strokes of the great axes, while from the rearward
ranks of the English host the same tempest of
darts, throwing-axes, and stone clubs crashed upon
the mail and helmets of the charging cavaliers.
After a furious struggle the Bretons and Angevins
were repulsed and driven downhill. After them
poured the ill-disciplined levies of the English right.
The retreating horsemen blundered into the marsh,
which they had avoided without difficulty as they
advanced, and, with the English pressing furiously
on their rear, were in wild disorder, when the victors
were suddenly charged in flank by part of the Norman
centre, turned against them by the watchful Duke.
The results were terrible. The scattered warriors,
many of them half-armed peasants, were overridden
and cut down by hundreds, and only a
remnant regained the position which they had so
rashly left.</p>

<p>This, however, was only the beginning. William
rallied the broken left wing, and again and again
the fierce horsemen charged the immovable English
line&mdash;in vain. Never had the knights seen or heard of
such foot-soldiers as these. One tremendous charge
led by William himself did burst through the shield-wall;
and the brave Gyrth went down beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Duke’s terrible mace. Leofwine, too, was slain; but
the charge was beaten off by a rally of the English
axemen, and hurled downhill, and the cry went up
that the Duke was slain. William flung himself
among the panic-stricken knights: ‘I live! I live!’
he thundered, tearing off his helmet. ‘By God’s aid
I will conquer yet!’ Out of evil came good&mdash;for
Normandy.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole Norman line was apparently in
disorder, but William rallied it again and brought
it up to the charge, though it is evident that
the attacks must have grown less and less effective
as time went on, owing to the fatigue of the horses.
At his wits’ end, William tried the expedient of a
feigned retreat; and the French on the right recoiled,
to all seeming broken and beaten, down the slope.
This was too much for the greatly enduring Englishmen,
and a great part of their left and centre came
pouring down in pursuit. The retreating horsemen
turned upon them; William assailed them in flank
with troops from his centre. The carnage was
great, and apparently the whole English left wing
was annihilated. But the pursuing horsemen appear
to have met with disaster in an unexpected trench or
watercourse, and Bishop Odo of Bayeux had to ride
among and steady them.</p>

<p>Still, the battle was far from over. The best
part of the English army, including the royal household,
was still ranged in dense masses on the crown
of the hill. But their line was sorely reduced by
the disaster of the wings, and the Norman cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
could charge in front and flank. Inspired by the
hope of victory, the knights hurled themselves again
to the attack, but still in vain. The line of shields
was an impregnable barrier; charge after charge
recoiled from the steadfast front and to the fierce
Norman war-cry of ‘<i>Dex aie!</i>’ (Dieu aide!) the
English shouts of ‘Holy Cross!’ still thundered in
defiant answer.</p>

<p class="subcap">Norman cavalry charging from both sides, and bowmen skirmishing, indicating the archery attack.</p>

<p class="subcap">(<i>From the Bayeux Tapestry.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>The Norman cavalry was growing more and more
wearied and ineffective; the victory was far from
decisive as long as the English centre still fought on.
Then at last William did what he should have attempted
long before, and brought his archers to the
front. Any East-Roman tactician would have told
him that the cavalry should never have attacked until
the English masses had been thoroughly shattered by
their fire, and the fact shows how low the art of war
had fallen in the West. Between the cavalry attacks
the bowmen poured in their volleys, shooting with a
high trajectory so that the arrows were not wasted
on the shield-wall, but made havoc in the heart of
the dense mass. The device had terrible success.
The picked warriors of England fell fast before the
pitiless rain to which they could not reply. For
the most part they could but suffer. Once or twice
it seems that small bodies tried to charge out; now
and again desperate warriors sprang forth to contend
hand-to-hand with the Norman knights, but they
only hastened their end. The splendid guards
stood shoulder to shoulder in the mass, never wavering
or faltering, but the losses were all on one side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Behind the unbroken shield-wall was an ever-increasing
weltering confusion of dead and dying
upon which the arrows beat pitilessly; and the
King, mortally wounded in the eye, lay in agony
beneath the standards. The position was desperate;
but so long as the banners waved and the King
lived there was no thought of yielding. But at last
the fatal gaps could not be closed fast enough, and
the Normans burst through the shield-wall. A
band of knights hewed their way through the
dissolving mass, cut down the faithful few round
Harold, tore down the Dragon and the Warrior,
and literally hacked the dying King to pieces at the
foot of his banners.</p>

<p>And now the end had come. The noble English
infantry, who had defied the Norman chivalry all
day, and but for the archery would have beaten them
to their ships, began&mdash;all that remained of them&mdash;to
withdraw sullenly but hopelessly. Even yet they
were not demoralized, and some were still in good
order. As the little remnant got away across
the saddleback into Andredsweald they saw the
Normans plunging rashly in pursuit down the steep
rearward slopes of Senlac. Turning to bay, true even
in that hour of despair, to their noble warrior strain,
they set upon the overweening horsemen, cut their
leading squadrons to pieces, and drove them back on
Senlac. Panic spread through the Norman army;
Eustace of Boulogne is said to have counselled
retreat, and it was only when William himself rallied
his squadrons and brought them along the ridge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
a properly ordered pursuit that the English finally
melted away into the woods.</p>

<p>Looking at the battle after this length of time, it
is clear that William only gained the day by desperate
exertions, and that more than once success hung in
the balance. Had the English army possessed a
proportion of archers the day would have been
Harold’s. It has been pointed out that not even a
great fleet saved England from an attack by an
invader prepared to take the risk of destruction.
But it should be remembered that Harold’s flotilla
was not a properly organized force, and cannot be
compared to a modern fleet able to keep the sea for
several months at a time. Even as it was, William
was very near destruction though, so far as we can
see, he caught Harold at a disadvantage. By calmly
taking such risks as few men could contemplate
unshaken, William did land in England, but his
success was due to a very remarkable combination
of circumstances which it would be well to recapitulate.</p>

<p>1. The English fleet, owing to its urgent need to
revictual, was absent from the chief danger-point at
the crucial moment, and at the rate of sailing in those
days the Thames, even with favourable winds, was
farther from Pevensey than Rosyth is to-day from
Portsmouth.</p>

<p>2. The English army at the moment when the
invasion was imminent was called to the defence of
the north.</p>

<p>3. The wind which had baffled William for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
six weeks shifted in his favour at the precise moment
when the English fleet and army were absent.</p>

<p>4. The extraordinary rapidity of Harold’s southward
march after his defeat of Hardrada left the
disorganized Northumbrian and Mercian levies far
in the rear.</p>

<p>5. The English were probably surprised into
giving battle when Harold would have preferred to
await support.</p>

<p>6. The English army was at a fatal tactical disadvantage
owing to its lack of archers.</p>

<p>William’s losses had been exceedingly heavy.
The mediæval chroniclers estimate that he lost
12,000 to 15,000 men out of 40,000 to 60,000, and
we may fairly estimate from this that his casualties
were about a fourth of his fighting strength. But
only a mere remnant of the English host survived
the day, and with the King fell every man of note
in southern England, except Esegar the Marshal,
who was desperately wounded. This awful destruction
of the leaders was the most disastrous feature of
the battle. There was, as after-events showed, a
complete dearth of men about whom the English
might rally.</p>

<p>In many ways the Battle of Hastings was itself the
Norman Conquest, though the events of the following
two or three years are rather those which gave
William his title of ‘Conqueror.’ The whole south-east
of England had been utterly crushed; there remained
for William only the conquest piecemeal of the
west and north. Kent was conquered with scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
any resistance, and William, advancing to the Thames,
beat back a sortie of the Londoners, burned Southwark,
and moved up the river feeling for a passage.
Detachments from his army occupied Winchester
and the neighbouring towns, and William, crossing
the Thames at Wallingford, marched upon London.
Eadwine and Morkere, who were there with the
forces which had been too late for Senlac, lost their
nerve when the Normans threatened their line of
retreat to the north. They hurriedly withdrew, and
the Londoners bowed to necessity. ‘They submitted
then for need, when the most harm was done,’
mourns the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.’</p>

<p>There is no reason to doubt that William, when
he promised to govern England well, had every
intention of keeping his word. But he probably
found it difficult from the outset to control the greedy
adventurers who followed him; and in any case he
was bound to reward them. When his strong hand
was temporarily removed by his return to Normandy,
the tyranny of Odo of Bayeux and the excesses of
the foreign nobles and soldiers soon produced revolt.
Yet there was nothing national in the various uprisings;
north, east, and west acted independently,
and of cordial co-operation there was not a sign. In
1067 William, returning from Normandy, subdued the
west and captured Exeter. Then, marching northward,
he overran Mercia and Northumbria. Nowhere
was there anything like an effective resistance; such
opposition as was made appears to have been mainly
inspired by King Malcolm of Scotland. Strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
garrisons were placed at York, Lincoln, Nottingham,
and other places, and earthworks thrown up, which
later were to grow into the frowning castles that
have somewhat incorrectly been associated with the
Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>The year 1069 saw the only serious and determined
attempt to overthrow the Norman rule. A
great Danish fleet, sent by Sweyn Estrithson,
arrived in the Humber, joined the Northumbrians,
and marched on York. It was stormed and captured,
and 30,000 foreign soldiers, it is said, were slain
or taken. But that was all, and the peril died down
before William’s vehement energy. The Danish
fleet was bought off&mdash;William was as ready as
Philip of Macedonia to use ‘silver spears.’ Then
the King reoccupied York, and, lest any succeeding
Scandinavian invasion should find a foothold,
wrought the awful devastation of the north&mdash;the
worst deed that stains his otherwise not ignoble
character. The north, wasted and ruined, was at his
feet, and the reappearance next year of Sweyn with a
great fleet ended in a mere fiasco. The Danes and
the East Anglian rebels did little but plunder abbeys,
and after sundry useless demonstrations the Danes
returned home.</p>

<p>There now remained in all England in arms against
William only the gathering in the Isle of Ely under
the famous outlaw Hereward. Thither came sundry
English leaders, powerless and discredited, who now
could only swell the band of an erstwhile obscure
chief. Eadwine had already disappeared&mdash;slain, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
says the ‘Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,’ by his own men.
Morkere succeeded in reaching Ely; but at best the
leaders were but a poor remnant. The position of
Ely, surrounded by its waters, was strong; but the
garrison was not sufficiently numerous to take the
offensive with any hope of success. William fixed
his headquarters at Cambridge; a fleet was collected
and brought up the Wash, and the lines of investment
were steadily drawn round the doomed stronghold.
A causeway was driven across the fens, and
when at last it reached firm land, after many checks
and surprises inflicted by the watchful Hereward,
Ely was forced to surrender. Legends have clustered
thickly about the figure of Hereward ‘the
Wake.’ He was certainly taken into William’s
favour, and was commanding troops for him on the
Continent some years later. The mass of the rank
and file, however, were treated with what seems to
us horrible barbarity, being maimed and mutilated
wholesale. The punishment of death the ‘stark’
and terrible Conqueror was always very chary of inflicting.
Famous as the defence of Ely has become,
it is noteworthy that the Chronicle does not seem
to regard it as other than an isolated incident
in the struggle. It is at any rate clear that it could
never have done more than temporarily check the
progress of the Conqueror, just as eighteen centuries
before the defence of Eira could only delay the
Spartan conquest of Messenia.</p>

<p>With the fall of Ely the Norman Conquest of
England was complete. The country settled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
beneath the yoke of William with resignation if not
cheerfulness, and the lack of further outbreaks seems
to indicate that after all his rule was not worse than
that of his immediate predecessors. Perhaps one
explanation of this submissiveness is that the English
thegnhood emigrated to Constantinople in large
numbers, so that the nation lacked its natural leaders,
but something must be set to William’s credit despite
his many faults and crimes. The fear of foreign
invasion died away; the Danish attacks in 1075 and
1085 were utterly futile. Englishmen, while they
hated William as the destroyer of their independence,
could not forget ‘the good peace that he made in
this land; so that a man of any account might fare
over his kingdom unhurt with his bosom full of gold.’
To keep the peace in a land was no slight thing in
those days of feudal anarchy; and if the Norman
Conquest was very far from being an unmixed
benefit, it at least brought about a better sense of
unity than had hitherto prevailed in England.</p>

<span class="subhead">CONTINENTAL INVASIONS</span>

<span class="subhead">1066&ndash;1545</span></h2>

<p>Since 1066&mdash;a period of over eight centuries&mdash;there
have been, apart from many sporadic raids, no great
successful invasions of England. On two occasions
relatively large forces have landed on these shores,
but in both cases they had the support of a considerable
part of the nation.</p>

<p>The first of these occasions was in 1216. King
John’s tyranny had at last produced something like
a general revolt&mdash;at any rate among his barons.
His assent to Magna Carta, given on June 15,
1215, had proved a farce, and his mercenary
armies were too strong for disorderly feudal and
civic levies. Further, John had declared himself
the vassal of Pope Innocent III., and thus ensured
his support. The men of London, the chief baronial
stronghold, stoutly withstood the thunders of Rome;
but their military weakness forced them to apply for
help to the Dauphin Louis, son of John’s great
enemy, Philip Augustus of France, whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
acknowledged as King. Despite the opposition of
the Pope, who finally excommunicated him, Louis
invaded England early in 1216.</p>

<p>England had possessed no regular standing navy
since the days of Edward the Confessor. The
ports, however, had steadily increased in prosperity
during the generally peaceful period 1066&ndash;1216;
and John, living in fear of invasion, had kept up a
large naval force collected from them. It is at
this time that the association of the Cinque Ports
becomes prominent, and, besides London, Yarmouth,
Fowey, Bristol, and other places, could send out
hundreds of small but well-manned craft. In 1214,
under John’s gallant half-brother, William ‘Longsword,’
they had gained the famous victory of
Damme. Their effectiveness was much diminished
by their lack of discipline and bloody feuds, but
when united they were formidable. John had succeeded
in conciliating them, and had they met
Louis at sea he would hardly have landed. But in
1216, as in 1066, the English fleet was wind-bound,
and Louis landed in Thanet on May 21.</p>

<p>The operations that followed are devoid of interest,
owing to their aimlessness. Most of the
south-east submitted to Louis, except Dover, which
made a magnificent resistance under Hubert de
Burgh. A memento of Louis’s domination survives
in the name of a row of ancient houses at
St. Albans, which are said to have lodged some
of his followers. King John made an attempt to
come to the relief of his faithful officer, but lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
baggage and treasure in the treacherous shallows
of the Wash, and died at Newark on October 19.</p>

<p>His son Henry, a boy of ten, was crowned
king at Gloucester by Cardinal Gualo, the Pope’s
legate. His chief supporter was William the
Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, an aged warrior, who
had held his present rank under Henry II. He
was also supported by a strong remnant of his
father’s mercenaries, under the fierce chief Faukes
de Bréauté, as well as by greedy but talented
officials of the type of Peter des Roches. Gualo
and the Marshal made great efforts to satisfy the
mercenary generals, and to keep their ruffianly
troops in hand.</p>

<p>Louis, on his side, distrusted his English supporters,
regarding them as traitors, and was short
of money to pay his own mercenaries. For a while
he continued to gain ground, but the dissensions
among his followers increased. The Royalists
promised that all past desertions should be forgiven
to those who returned to their allegiance, and barons
began to change sides once more. The Cinque
Ports, which had submitted to Louis, now repented.
The Wealden peasants rose against him under an
esquire named William de Cassingham (‘Wilkin of
the Weald’), and practically besieged Louis in
Winchelsea, which was patriotically deserted by its
inhabitants. He was at last relieved by a French
fleet, but the Royalists meanwhile regained most of
the south. Meanwhile, however, his lieutenant in
London, Enguerrand de Coucy, had organized a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
force under Gilbert of Ghent, which marched northward
and besieged Lincoln.</p>

<p>Louis, much disheartened, went to France for
reinforcements; but as he was now under the ban of
the Pope, he obtained little support, since his cautious
father dared not act openly. He was, however,
joined by the Counts of Brittany and Perche and
other nobles, with some 120 knights and their
followings, and brought back with him to England
a train of siege engines. The engines, however,
made no impression on Dover; and Lincoln
Castle, gallantly defended by its châtelaine, Nicola
de Camville, was defiant.</p>

<p>Blanche of Castille, Louis’s wife, regardless of
Papal thunders, was collecting fresh forces in France
to aid her husband. Louis, in London, had the
choice of moving either north or south. In the
south the Royalists were very strong, though Winchester
still was Louis’s, and the Prince resolved to
turn his strength northward. A force under the
Count of Perche, Robert Fitzwalter, who had been
the Marshal of the baronial army in the preceding
year, and Saer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester,
accordingly marched to assist Gilbert of Ghent at
Lincoln. The fall of the Castle now appeared imminent.
The besieging army consisted of over
600 knights and their followers. William the Marshal
came in haste from the south and joined Peter
des Roches and Faukes de Bréauté at Newark.</p>

<p class="subcap"><i>From an engraving (by T.&nbsp;A. Dean) after the portrait by Holbein.</i></p></div></div>

<p>The Royalist army consisted of 400 knights’
retinues, and 300 mercenary crossbowmen&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
probably only about 700 really effective troops.
They wore white crosses on their garments as
the army of Holy Church, and were solemnly
blessed before they set out by Cardinal Gualo&mdash;a
ceremony which may or may not have appealed to
Bréauté’s swashbucklers. On May 20 they were
outside Lincoln. The crossbowmen were passed
safely into the Castle, and the knights charged into
the town by the north gate. The French seem
to have had no proper guard at any of the
entrances. They fought gallantly in the streets, but
were finally driven out by Bargate. It became
blocked, and hundreds of knights, including Robert
Fitzwalter, were taken. The Count of Perche
was slain by a spear-thrust in the eye. Only a
few knights fell, but there was a frightful massacre
of their followers and the hapless citizens,
while so much plunder was gained that the Royalists
called the combat ‘The Fair of Lincoln.’</p>

<p>This defeat was a severe blow to the hopes of
Louis, but he still held firm at London, watching for
his reinforcements. The Dauphiness had collected
several hundred knights and large supplies, which
were to be conveyed to England by Eustace the
Monk, a renegade ecclesiastic, now a noted pirate
chief, with a fleet of 100 sail. On August 23
it sailed from Calais, but as all the south-eastern
ports were hostile, and were held in force
by the Marshal, who had his headquarters at
Sandwich, it turned up Dover Straits to round the
North Foreland and put into the Thames. As it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
passed Dover, the Cinque Ports squadron, some forty
vessels under Hubert de Burgh himself, put out to the
attack. The ships were well manned with bowmen
(or crossbowmen) under Philip d’Albini, and quicklime
was provided for use against boarders. The
heavily laden French ships were at a hopeless disadvantage.
The English seamen manœuvred for
the wind, and, having gained it, bore down on their
encumbered foes. The result was an overwhelming
victory. Robert de Courtenay, the leader of the
reinforcements, was taken prisoner. So, too, was
the Monk, who, having been in the English service,
was immediately beheaded. Many knights were
slain, others drowned themselves in despair, and
only fifteen ships escaped. The victory had decisive
results. Louis at once made peace, submitting to
the Pope’s legate, and abandoning all hopes of the
English crown. Hubert de Burgh became the
darling of England. Years later, when he had fallen
into disgrace with Henry III., a smith who was
ordered to fetter him threw down hammer and chains
and swore that he would never put iron upon the
man who had saved England from a foreign yoke.</p>

<p>For more than three centuries there was little
that can be described as a serious invasion of
England from the sea. The constant raids and
counter-raids of the more than half-piratical seamen
of the Channel ports, indeed, went on unchecked.
The State Papers afford ample evidence that piracy
was rife among the seamen of the English ports.
During the ‘Hundred Years’ War’ with France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
these raids became of national significance. At
first the English held the command of the sea by
their famous victories of Sluys in 1340 and
‘L’Espagnols sur Mer’ in 1350, but after 1372
it passed to the allied French and Castilians. As
early as 1360 Winchelsea was sacked&mdash;a fate it
again suffered in 1361. In 1369 Portsmouth was
burned. In 1372 the French and Spaniards gained
a complete victory over the English off La Rochelle.
France had now a capable admiral in Jean de
Vienne, and in 1377 he carried devastation along
the English coast. The Isle of Wight was
wasted, and Dartmouth, Plymouth, Yarmouth,
Rye, Hastings, and Portsmouth, sacked one after
another. The English were helpless, and the
French sailed up the Thames to Gravesend,
which shared the fate of the other ports. The
Patent Rolls of this period are full of records of the
prevailing panic and disaster.</p>

<p>Something was done to retaliate by raids on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
France, but with little success. In 1380 the main
Franco-Spanish fleet endeavoured to raid Ireland,
but was severely defeated by the ships of Devon
and Bristol at Kinsale. Yet in the same year
Winchelsea was again destroyed. It never recovered,
and its once splendid church was reduced
to the fragment which still survives. In 1385 De
Vienne sailed to the Forth, and helped the Scots to
invade England. A great effort, however, in 1386,
to equip a vast fleet for the invasion of England
failed utterly, and the English port squadrons made
lucrative raids upon the French ships as they lay
rotting on the coasts. This failure practically put an
end to active French operations, but they still retained
to a great extent the command of the sea. In 1403
a French squadron sacked Plymouth, and landed
a few men to assist the great Welsh rebel, Owen
Glendower. Another squadron raided the Isle of
Wight, but was repulsed by the men of Hampshire.</p>

<p>In August, 1405, a large French fleet appeared
in Milford Haven, and landed 800 horsemen and
1,800 infantry, under the Maréchal Jean de Rieux
and Jean de Hangest, Master of the Crossbows.
Glendower joined them with 10,000 men. The
allies took Tenby, Haverfordwest, and Caermarthen,
and brought Henry IV. westward with a large
army. Glendower starved him into a retreat, and
captured much of the royal baggage, including
Henry’s crown and robes. But the French fleet
was defeated by Lord Berkeley, and the French
soldiers worked as ill with the Welsh as with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Scots (see Chapter XI.). They drifted home in
detachments during 1405 and 1406, and Glendower
was left to maintain alone his gallant but hopeless
contest with England.</p>

<p>For over a hundred years France made no further
attempt. She interfered at different times in the
English dynastic broils, but not until 1545 was
there any attempt at a great invasion. During this
period, despite civil and foreign war, the idea of a
true royal navy had never been really lost sight of.
Henry VII. had given the question serious attention,
and his vigorous son took a strong personal
interest in naval matters. The consequence was
that by 1543, when war threatened with France, he
had a really formidable naval force.</p>

<p>When war broke out England was in alliance
with the Emperor Charles V., while France’s only
supporter was gallant but feeble Scotland. The
result was that the English Navy wasted the
Scottish and French coasts, and swept French
commerce off the sea. But in 1545 François I.
succeeded in detaching Charles from the alliance.
He then slowly collected a huge fleet. There
finally assembled nearly 150 great-ships (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gros
vaisseaux ronds</i>), 60 oared vessels of 40 or 50 tons
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">flouins</i>), and 25 galleys from the Mediterranean.
Besides the crews, there were 10,000 troops on
board under the Maréchal Biez. The Commander-in-Chief
was Admiral d’Annibault. Paulin, Baron
de la Garde, and Leone Strozzi, Admiral of the
Galleys of Rhodes, commanded the galleys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Henry had ample intelligence of the intended invasion.
The whole of the available naval strength
of England was concentrated at Spithead under the
command of John, Lord Lisle, High Admiral of
England, afterwards Duke of Northumberland. It
consisted of ‘great-ships’ built in England or purchased
abroad, ‘galleasses’&mdash;really galleons, or
ships built on finer lines than the ordinary great-ship
(see Chapter XIII.), and small craft. To deal
with the free-moving galleys Henry had himself
designed thirteen row-barges, fast, handy little vessels
of about 20 tons, armed with several small guns,
and propelled by sweeps as well as sails. The flagship
was an unwieldy giant of 1,000 tons, the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Harry Grâce-à-Dieu</i>. The total number of vessels
was over 100. The majority of the crews were
soldiers; the supreme importance of the seaman
was not yet realized. In view of the apparent
superiority of the enemy Lisle was ordered to remain
on the defensive. No less than 120,000 men were
levied for land defence, organized in four armies.</p>

<p>D’Annibault sailed from Havre on July 14.
On the 16th he was off the coast of Sussex, where
he wasted time in pillaging fishing-villages. He
then moved on to the Isle of Wight, and anchored
off St. Helens. Next day the galleys engaged the
English fleet at long range without result. On the
18th the French threatened an attack in three
divisions of ships, with the galleys as an advance
guard. There was a dead calm, and for a while
the long 60-pounders of the galleys made good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
practice. But before long a breeze sprang up, and
Lisle weighed so smartly that the galleys were nearly
caught before they could put about. They succeeded
in doing so, however, and retired slowly, with the
object of drawing on the English great-ships. Lisle,
however, would not be enticed, and sent the row-barges
in pursuit. They chased with great daring,
and before the long galleys could turn on their nimble
tormentors they had been well peppered. Had the
French made a serious attack, Lisle had formed an
able plan for their discomfiture. He designed to
fall with his whole force on their right wing and
drive them upon the dangerous shoals of the
‘Owers’ which stretch eastward from the Isle of
Wight. The wind, however, was unfavourable, and
without it he would not abandon his strong position.</p>

<p>As it was obvious that Lisle was not to be drawn
out, the French landed raiding parties in the Isle
of Wight. They were roughly handled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
garrison, and then D’Annibault
gave up and retired.

<p>D’Annibault made some
more irritating and futile
raids on Sussex, and then
went back to Havre,
landed 7,000 of his scurvy-stricken
troops, and returned
to sail aimlessly
about the Channel. Meanwhile
Henry, annoyed at
finding that the galleys
could thus beard him at
his very door, had ordered
some of his lighter ships
to be fitted with sweeps.
Having effected this, Lisle
cleared from Spithead
about August 11, with 104
sail. He had carefully
organized his fleet, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
flagships all carried special flags by day and lights

<p>On the 15th the two fleets encountered off
Shoreham. Lisle intended to attack the French
great-ships, which were close inshore, with the
‘Battle’ and the ‘Vawarde,’ while the ‘Wing’ of
oared craft kept off the galleys. Before he could
close, however, the wind fell. The fighting was only
between the galleys and Tyrrell. The advantage
rested with the English. Lisle stated that the oared
craft ‘did so handle the galleys, as well with their
sides as with their prows, that your great ships in a
manner had little to do;’ and in the night the
French drew off. They went home and dispersed,
and so in this impotent fashion the greatest
invasion of England that had yet been planned
flickered out. Lisle was able to burn Tréport,
and retaliate for the raids on Sussex; and
towards the close of the war an action was
fought off Ambleteuse, south of Cape Gris-Nez.
There were eight French galleys against four
English ‘galleasses’ and four pinnaces. It is
notable because the English declined to close, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
relied chiefly upon steady gun-fire. The galleys
were severely mauled, and one of them taken.</p>

<p>The attack of François I. was the first serious
attempt at an invasion of England by France from
the sea since the abortive effort in 1386. It was not
to be the last, though all were to be fruitless; but
not for more than 250 years was a hostile French
soldier to set foot on English soil, and then but for
a moment.</p>

<span class="subhead">SCOTTISH INVASIONS</span>

<span class="subhead">1018&ndash;1424</span></h2>

<p>Shakespeare in ‘King Henry V.’ puts into the
King’s mouth the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘For you shall read that my great-grandfather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never went with his forces into France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that the Scot on his unfurnish’d kingdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came pouring like the tide into a breach.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And the words express sufficiently well the popular
opinion of Scotland as the especial and persevering
enemy of England. Like a good many popular
opinions, it is only partly true. Yet it has a foundation
of fact, in so far that for some three centuries
England and Scotland were generally at war. Still,
this condition of chronic hostility was not reached
until the reign of Edward I., and before then the
two countries had no more than the amount of warfare
that might have been expected of two adjacent
and warlike peoples.</p>

<p>It has already been noticed that Constantine III.’s
vague acknowledgment of English suzerainty had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
had less success from the political point of view
than he had hoped for, and that his attempt to
unite the disaffected sections of the English Empire
had met with crushing disaster. The old King,
bereaved and broken-hearted, withdrew to ‘his
northland,’ and for many years the Scottish kingdom,
slowly growing together out of its discordant
elements of Scots, Picts, and Strathclyde Britons,
was content to remain a sort of appendage of its
powerful neighbour.</p>

<p>But with the break-up of the English Empire in
the beginning of the eleventh century, the unsubstantial
allegiance of Scotland grew more than ever
shadowy. In 1018 occurred an event which had
consequences of profound importance. England
had just come under the rule of Cnut. Deira was
governed by Eric Haakonson, but the Bernicians
held out against him under Eardwulf ‘Cudel.’
Malcolm II. of Scotland, a vigorous ruler, saw his
chance. He had long coveted Lothian, and had
made various futile attacks upon it. In 1006 he
had pushed southward as far as Durham, and had
there been defeated by Earl Uhtred. But this time
he was more fortunate. Eardwulf, attacked by Eric,
had more upon his hands than he could cope with,
when Malcolm with his vassal, Eugenius of Strathclyde,
invaded Bernicia. He overran Lothian without
assistance, and at Carham, on the Tweed, gained
a crushing victory over the weak Bernician host,
almost exterminating it. The result of the victory
was the permanent union of Lothian to Scotland. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Cnut it was a matter of small importance; probably
he regarded it as better that Lothian should belong
to the apparently loyal Scot than the rebellious
Eardwulf. In 1027 Malcolm paid a formal homage
to the Emperor of the North. But the Lothians
and the Merse became an integral part of Scotland,
and their sturdy Teutonic population proved the
nucleus about which the inchoate and distracted
realm eventually solidified into a single state.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to say that, as soon as
Cnut was in his grave, Malcolm’s successor Duncan
threw off his allegiance. In 1040 he invaded
Bernicia. The line of the Tyne was as yet undefended,
and he pressed on to Dunholm (Durham),
where the south Bernician levies had taken refuge.
Making a gallant sortie, they completely routed the
disorderly swarm of Picts, Scots, and Britons, and
celebrated their victory by raising a bloody trophy
of severed heads.</p>

<p>Duncan’s prestige as successor of the conqueror
Malcolm II. was shattered by this defeat, and he
was at once involved in war with his many unruly
vassals. Soon after the battle of Dunholm he
was defeated, and slain by his general Macbeth,
‘Mormaer’ (hereditary chief) of Moray, who
assumed the crown, and ruled very successfully for
seventeen years. It was not until 1057 that he was
slain in battle by Malcolm ‘Canmore,’ the son and
heir of Duncan.</p>

<p>Malcolm early began to interfere in English
affairs. He may be very fairly compared to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
early kings of Parthia, whose single object was to
add territory to their own narrow lands. Malcolm’s
power, however, was not equal to his energy and
ambition. Like the kings of Bulgaria in their
relations with the Eastern Empire, he might gain
temporary successes, but in the end the victory
inclined to the larger and more powerful state; nor,
despite the courage of her people and their stubborn
pride in their nationality, was Scotland ever a
dangerous rival. At her best she was a troublesome
neighbour, and as England naturally moved faster
on the path of progress than her poor and politically
hampered foe, the chances were more and more
against the latter ever gaining a decisive success.</p>

<p>Scotland has been well served by her poets.
The average Englishman is generally serenely
ignorant of the very names of his ancestors’ victories;
while not merely Bannockburn, but a score
of minor matters&mdash;mostly mere Border skirmishes&mdash;are
celebrated by Scott, and referred to with pride.
This radical difference between the standpoints of
the two nations can hardly be ignored.</p>

<p>The hope of making further acquisitions of
Northumbrian territory was undoubtedly the main
motive of Scots kings for two centuries after
Carham. Malcolm III. made a raid on Northumberland
in 1061, but the savagery of his followers
can hardly have helped his cause. Later he is
found in alliance with Tosti, the rebellious brother
of Harold II.</p>

<p>Malcolm’s hopes were rudely checked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
events of 1066. William’s introduction of a highly
centralized rule ensured that for the future Northumbria
would not be left to fight her own battles
unaided, or, at least, unavenged. Yet for a time
Malcolm’s marriage to Margaret, sister of Eadgar
the Aetheling, and the considerable immigration
into Scotland of fugitive Englishmen, seemed to
promise otherwise. Cumberland, it must be remembered,
was at present a part of Scotland, having
been granted by Eadmund I., after his conquest of
it, as a fief to Malcolm I., and Carlisle was an
excellent base of operations. In 1070 Malcolm,
starting thence, made another savage raid into
Northumberland. William thereupon proceeded
northward next year, with a great army and a
fleet, and penetrated to the Tay. Malcolm made
a vague submission, but in 1079, during William’s
absence in Normandy, he made a third raid, which
was replied to by a counter raid under Prince
Robert. A fortress was then constructed on the
Tyne to defend southern Bernicia, called the ‘New
Castle.’ The result was immediate. Malcolm made
no further attack for twelve years, and was then
checked by the garrison of Newcastle. He made
some kind of submission, but Cumberland was
conquered by a treacherous attack of William Rufus,
and the English king’s insults drove him to madness.
He once more invaded Northumberland, and
near Alnwick was defeated and slain.</p>

<p>For many years after the famous king’s death
there were no Scottish invasions. Scotland was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
much troubled with civil war, and afterwards divided
between two sons of Malcolm. It was not until
1124 that David I. reunited the country under his
rule. For eleven years his relations with England
were peaceful, but when Stephen of Blois usurped
the English throne, the Scottish king invaded
Northumberland, nominally to support his niece, the
Empress Matilda, really, of course, to make his
profit out of the situation. Northumberland and
Durham readily submitted to him as the representative
of Matilda, and Stephen, pressed by many
difficulties, was glad to purchase his withdrawal by
the retrocession of Carlisle, nominally to David’s
son Henry, who also received Doncaster and the
Earldom of Huntingdon. But the great English
magnates were bitterly indignant, and in 1138 war
again broke out.</p>

<p>David invaded Northumberland at the very
beginning of the year. Already castles were arising,
and he failed to take Wark, but wasted the open
country, his hordes of wild mountaineers committing
terrible atrocities. Stephen hastened northward,
and David retreated; but the English king, with
rebellion in the south, could only waste Lothian
and withdraw. David thereupon reassembled his
forces and again advanced. Norham Castle was
taken, Wark again besieged, the levies of Lancashire
defeated by the King’s nephew William at Clitheroe,
and the Scottish host poured over Tees into Yorkshire.
There it encountered solid resistance. Its
barbarities had exasperated the country-folk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
they rallied <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> to oppose the invaders. The
nominal commander-in-chief was the young William
of Albemarle, but Thurstan, Archbishop of York,
and Sir Walter Espec, the High Sheriff, were the
real leaders.</p>

<p>The men of Yorkshire, with reinforcements from
Durham, Derby, and Nottingham, assembled at
Northallerton, and took up a position on Cowton
Moor some distance to the northward. On
August 22 they were attacked by the Scots.</p>

<p>David had with him a heterogeneous host from
all parts of his dominions&mdash;said, with considerable
probability, to have been 26,000 strong. But it
was very unstable. The Picts of Alban were
jealous of the ‘Saxons’ of Lothian, and neither
were inclined to work well with the Britons of
Strathclyde. The Niduarian Picts of Galloway
were uncontrollable, and all the old elements of the
realm disliked the new Norman-Teutonic immigrants,
although their small force of about 500
mailed horsemen was to show itself the one
thoroughly reliable arm of the host.</p>

<p>The English army was, without any doubt, greatly
inferior in number, as is shown by the fact that it
maintained a passive defensive&mdash;the last plan of
action likely to be adopted by the fiery Norman-English
knights unless there had been compelling
reason for it. The bulk of the force consisted of
the country levies, but the whole knighthood of
Yorkshire were there, and there was a strong contingent
of archers. Albemarle and Espec formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
their army into one solid mass, probably with the
mail-clad knights and their followers dismounted
as a front rank. In the centre of the line was a
waggon with a tall mast stepped in it, from which
flew the sacred banners of St. Peter of York,
St. Cuthbert of Durham, St. Wilfrid of Ripon, and
St. John of Beverley; and beneath their shadow
old Walter Espec and Albemarle took their stand,
with a band of chosen warriors as a guard. The
horses were sent to the rear, and the barons and
knights promised to stand and die with the country-folk.</p>

<p>There was a hot and unfriendly debate in the
Scottish host, which shows how incoherent it was.
David, according to Aelred of Rievaulx, had intended
to attack in one huge column, with the mailed
cavalry in front; but the Picts violently objected.
Malise, Earl of Strathearn, declared that the
‘Saxons’ were no better than cowards, and that he
himself, though he wore no mail, would outstrip
the best of them in the charge. Alan Percy hotly
replied, and the King was obliged to part the
two. The Galwegians, who had distinguished
themselves at Clitheroe, were equally furious and
insubordinate, and eventually David had to consent
to deliver his attack in territorial divisions. On the
right, under the King’s gallant son Henry, were the
Strathclydians with two hundred knights at their
head. On the left were the men of Lothian, with
some Argyll and Isles men; and in the centre, in
advance of the wings, were the Galwegians with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
probably, other Pictish contingents. Behind the
centre King David led a reserve consisting of the
men of Moray and other Highland regions, with all
the knights not on the wings.</p>

<p>As the Scottish masses moved forward they were
assailed with showers of arrows, and the wild
Galwegians raced to handgrips just as, for centuries
thereafter, the Highland clans were to charge,
brandishing their swords and yelling ‘Albanach!
Albanach!’ as they dashed through the deadly hail.
The English line gave back for a moment before
the impact of the rush, but rallied at once and stood
firm&mdash;a wall of steel upon which the Celtic billows
beat fiercely, but without avail. On the left the
men of Lothian and Lorn did badly. They had
never agreed together. Perhaps the Lowlanders
had little heart in the fight against their Northumbrian
kinsmen. Their leader was killed in the
advance, and the whole wing gave back after the
first charge, taking no further part in the battle.</p>

<p>On the Scottish right matters went differently.
The Strathclydians charged gallantly, and the
knights in front burst right through the English
line, penetrating to the baggage and horses in the
rear. But so fine was the spirit of the Yorkshire
men, that they rallied and re-formed in the very
face of the enemy, and cut off the Strathclydian
infantry from Henry’s squadron. The fight raged
fiercely along the line, the Scots rallying again and
again, and hurling themselves in repeated charges
against the close English ranks. The hardest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
best fighting seems to have been done by the
Galwegians in the centre. They held on to the
English line for two hours, and made three furious
assaults. Not until the third had been repelled,
and their chiefs Donald and Ulgarich slain, did they
sullenly give back, many of them, as Aelred says,
‘looking like hedgehogs with the arrows sticking
in them.’ The Strathclyde men also were in retreat,
and Prince Henry, cut off with the remnant
of his gallant band, was vainly endeavouring to
rejoin the main body. The King’s reserve was
demoralized by the sight of the retreat of the left
and the repeated repulse of the Picts and Strathclydians,
refused to advance, and broke up. David
was left among his dissolving host with only his
few hundred horsemen. He fell back some way,
and raised his banner on a hill. Around it the
ruins of the right and centre, with the disgraced
left and reserve, gradually rallied, unmolested by
the English, who knew that only half the Scottish
host had been seriously engaged, and were unaware
of the dissensions that had rendered it ineffective.
Then David began his retreat to Carlisle, cautiously
pursued by Espec and Albemarle. At Carlisle
Prince Henry at last rejoined, having given away
his encumbering mail to a peasant, and with only
nineteen of his two hundred horsemen still with him.</p>

<p>The result of the ‘Battle of the Standards’ was
highly honourable to the English Northerners, but
it is easy to see that the hopeless lack of cordial
co-operation between the various sections of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Scottish host ensured its defeat. In a modified
form this want of cohesion continued to the last to
affect the efficiency of Scottish armies of invasion.
David continued to fish in the agitated waters of
English politics, and during his reign retained
practical possession of Northumberland and Durham,
save for a few castles; but he made no more invasions
in force, and after his death Henry II. recovered
the northern counties.</p>

<p>The invasion of William the Lion, in 1174, was
made ostensibly to aid the rebellious sons of
Henry II. against their father. William’s true
object was, no doubt, to recover the border
counties. Perhaps no invasion of England has
ever appeared so threatening, and proved so completely
‘the fleeting shadow of a dream.’ William’s
army was large&mdash;perhaps the largest that a Scots
king had hitherto gathered&mdash;but he could not control
his wild followers. His advance was marked
by ravage and destruction&mdash;peculiarly stupid in
view of the fact that he hoped to annex the country
which he was ruining. Several fortresses were
captured, and in July he besieged Alnwick. He
kept only a very small force about him, and allowed
the main portion of his probably unruly host to
spread over the country for purpose of pillage.
The consequences of the dispersion were disastrous.
The troops of the North had already assembled
under Robert d’Estuteville, Sheriff of Yorkshire,
and were marching against the invaders. A body
of some four hundred horsemen was scouting ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
of the main body, and so hopelessly were the Scots
scattered that they passed, apparently unchallenged,
through the enemy’s line into his rear. Before the
walls of Alnwick they saw a small body of about
a hundred horsemen engaged in exercising and
tilting. They can hardly have expected that they
would be so rash as to charge their own superior
numbers. Yet so it was. Practically the whole of
the tilting band were taken, and the astonishment
of the victors may be imagined when they found
that they had captured the King of Scots. The
Scottish army melted away across the Border. The
King paid dearly for his recklessness. He was
forced to become Henry’s vassal, and so remained
until the death of the Angevin king. Richard I.
very wisely freed him from this humiliation in
return for a money payment, but there were no
more Scottish invasions of England for many
years. The Scottish kings never gave up their
hopes of gaining Northumberland, and more than
once hostilities appeared to threaten; but on the
whole the relations between the two countries were
peaceful, and when Alexander III. died in 1286
there had been no real outbreak of war for a century.</p>

<p>This peaceful period came to an end when
Edward I. made his attempt to unite the two
countries. That his aim was wise and statesmanlike
is not to be doubted. There was no strong
dividing line between the great mass of the English
nation and the Scots Lowlanders, who, for all practical
purposes, formed one race. The two countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
had been in close and generally peaceful connection
for over a century; the estates of many of the
magnates lay on both sides of the Border. On
the subject of the repeated ‘commendations’ of the
Scottish kings to those of England, opinion will
always be divided; but to Edward’s legal mind they
must have appeared to constitute a strong body of
precedents. Nor does it, on the whole, appear that
there was at first any great disinclination to the
union among the Scots. It was Edward’s highhandedness,
and the blundering violence of his
officials, who were foolish enough to treat the
country like a conquered land, that slowly roused
the pride and courage of the Scots.</p>

<p>In 1297 Scotland was in full revolt under William
Wallace, and after his famous victory at Cambuskenneth
he invaded northern England while Edward
was absent in France. For some three months the
Scots ranged over the English Border counties.
Newcastle and Carlisle successfully held out, but
the open country was swept bare. The chronicler
Hemingburgh accuses the Scots of committing unmentionable
atrocities, but practically admits that
Wallace was not to blame for them, being unable
to control his followers. There exists a letter of
protection granted by him and his colleagues to
Hexham Abbey, and doubtless there were others.
Still, great barbarities appear to have been perpetrated,
and it was largely owing to them that
Edward conceived his furious animosity against the
Scottish patriot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
In the stress of their struggle for independence
with Edward I. the Scots contrived to make a raid
on Cumberland in 1299, but by 1305 the country
was at the feet of the English king. Not until
Robert Bruce had taken the lead in Scotland, and
the worthless Edward II. had succeeded his great
father, were the northern borders again troubled.
In 1310, and again in 1311, Robert raided Northumberland,
and in 1313 he swept through Cumberland,
joined a fleet which he had sent from the Isles
and the Clyde, and annexed the Norse principality
of Man. In 1314 he gained the supreme victory
of Bannockburn. The independence of Scotland
appeared assured and the way open for invasions
of England.</p>

<p>Between 1314 to 1323 the Scots invaded England
repeatedly. All their operations were of a guerrilla
type, and rarely appear to have aimed at more than
the devastation of the country-side. Robert, himself
one of the ablest generals of mediæval days, had no
illusions as to the ability of Scotland to cope single-handed
with her strong antagonist, and his famous
testamentary counsel to always avoid action and to
endeavour to starve invaders out of the country is
well known.</p>

<p>The armies which carried out the invasions of
England during this heyday of Scotland’s renown
were well adapted for their purpose. They included
a force of mail-clad men-at-arms strong enough to
overcome any local resistance which might be
offered, and a much larger contingent of light-armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
men mounted on rough, hardy, country ponies.
Each man carried a bag of oatmeal on his horse,
and an iron plate whereon to bake it. Otherwise
men and beasts lived on the country through
which they passed. The hardy, frugal Scots were
quite at home in this rough-and-ready campaigning,
and for several years they rode at will over northern
England.</p>

<p>There is generally a lack of interest about the
invasions themselves, which all bore almost the
same image and superscription. Once the Border
was crossed, the Scots rode far and wide over the
northern counties, ravaging, plundering, or ransoming
villages, towns, and castles, much as the
Vikings had done four centuries before. There was
little fighting as a rule. England was at war with
herself. And when once or twice English armies
did assemble, the Scots simply avoided an action
until they were starved into dispersion.</p>

<p>In 1314 Edward Bruce and the ‘Good Lord’
James Douglas wasted the English Border. In
1315 Bruce himself attacked Carlisle, but it repulsed
him. For the next two years the main
energy of Scotland was devoted to Edward Bruce’s
attempted conquest of Ireland, but Douglas was
busy on the Border; and such was the dread of
him in the North that his name was used to
frighten disobedient children, and the humiliation
of the times is depicted in the lullaby:</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>
<p>In 1318 Berwick was taken, and a large English
army was driven in ruinous retreat from an attempted
counter-invasion of Scotland in the following year.
In 1320 the best of Robert’s captains, the famous
Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, assisted by
Douglas, retaliated. They pressed on across
Northumberland and Durham into Yorkshire, and
at Myton-on-Swale encountered the local levies
under the Archbishop of York. Perhaps the Primate
hoped to repeat the famous day of the ‘Standards.’
But the results were far otherwise. The Yorkshiremen
were totally routed; 3,000 men were slain and
so many of the ecclesiastics, who were present to
encourage the peasants, that the fray was called
‘Myton Chapter’ by the victors.</p>

<p>The result was that King Robert planned a campaign
in 1322, which should be more than a mere
marauding expedition. The English obtained intelligence,
and Edward II. collected a large army at
Newcastle. The Scottish king, therefore, stood on
the defensive in Lothian, while a strong detachment
crossed the western border and penetrated into mid-Lancashire.
Edward found Lothian desolate, and
effected nothing but the destruction of some abbeys&mdash;notably
those of Melrose and Dryburgh. Bruce
declined to fight, and the English army, perishing
from famine and disease, melted away over the
Border. So ruined were the northern counties of
England that Edward could not halt until he
reached Byland Abbey in Yorkshire. There so
much as remained of the dissolving host lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
security, when, on October 14, like a bolt from the
blue, the royal army of Scotland was upon them!</p>

<p>When the English army broke up, Bruce had
followed from across the Forth, and had passed
through Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire
so swiftly that no tidings of his march seem to
have reached the astounded English. Early on
October 14 the Scots fell upon the scattered
English divisions. There was little effective resistance;
a connected line of battle was never
indeed formed. Edward fled in haste, abandoning
his baggage and military chest. A part of his army
attempted to make a stand at a good position in the
rear of their cantonments. Douglas, whose division
was leading the pursuit, attacked in front, assisted
by Moray, who hurried in advance of his troops to
serve under ‘Good Lord James.’ For a time the
English held their own, but when the Highlanders
arrived on the field the end came swiftly. The
barefooted mountaineers scrambled up the crags
which covered the English wings, and charged in
flank and rear. The English fled in panic-stricken
rout, and Walter the Steward took up the pursuit,
chasing the fugitives to the gates of York.</p>

<p>On May 30, 1323, Edward at last bowed his
pride to calling a truce. It was time, for the suffering
North was already making terms of its own
with King Robert. The truce was ill-kept, and in
1327 broken by the Scots. This was a diplomatic
blunder on the part of King Robert; but the disorder
in England at the deposition of the witless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Edward II. was so great that he can hardly be
blamed for seizing the opportunity. He himself
was already dying, but Moray and Douglas led the
army across the Border on this last great successful
Scottish invasion of England. Its strength is stated
at 24,000 men, but it was probably less. The
English Regency assembled a strong force at
York under the nominal command of the boy-King
Edward III., but its operations were utterly futile.
It literally lost its way in the Border wilderness,
and only ascertained the whereabouts of the Scots
from a released prisoner, Thomas of Rokeby. Even
then the Scottish position was found too strong to
be assailed, and though Douglas would have accepted
young Edward’s proposal&mdash;fantastic, but quite in
the spirit of the times&mdash;to withdraw far enough to
allow him to form order of battle, the able and
prudent Moray rightly refused to listen. For fifteen
days the armies confronted each other, the English
suffering far more than their foes; and then Moray
quietly retreated under cover of a daring night
surprise of the English camp executed by Douglas.
Three hundred men were killed, and Edward’s tent
was almost cut down over his head before the bold
warrior was obliged to retire. The supplies left
behind by the Scots saved the English from immediate
starvation, and that was all. The expense
of the armament had, for the moment, exhausted
England, and by the ‘Shameful Treaty’ of Northampton,
April 24, 1328, the independence of Scotland
was formally recognized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
From the high position to which she had been
raised by Robert I. Scotland fell fast. The anarchy
which followed his death bade fair to undo his life-work.
Edward III. of England assisted Edward
Balliol, son of the ill-omened John, to attack Scotland,
and himself made repeated attempts to destroy
her newly-gained independence. In these he was
baffled, but numerous strong places on the Border
remained in English hands. The need of an ally
against England drove Scotland into the arms of
France, and the country became little better than an
appendage of the Continental Power. The ill effects
of this are to be traced in Scottish history for two
centuries.</p>

<p>In 1346 King David II., the weak successor of
his great father, determined to invade England as a
diversion in favour of France. Edward III. was
besieging Calais, and David appears to have been
certain of success. His army is said to have included
2,000 men-at-arms, 20,000 light cavalry,
and 10,000 infantry. He invaded England by the
Western Marches, and sacked Lanercost Priory,
a circumstance which evoked bitter denunciations
of him and his from the Lanercost Chronicle.
Moving on westward, David stormed the ‘Pyle’<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a>
of Liddell, hanging its commander, Walter de
Selby, and advanced to Bearpark, about six miles
from Bishop Auckland, where he encamped on
October 16.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F" id="Footnote_F" href="#FNanchor_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> Obviously another rendering of the well-known term ‘Peel’&mdash;Border
stronghold.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile the levies of the North had gathered
to oppose his farther advance. Edward’s youthful
son, Lionel, was the nominal guardian of the realm,
but the real head of the government was Queen
Philippa, who herself was in the North to expedite
measures of defence. Though it is probably untrue
that she accompanied the army to the field, it is
highly probable that she personally directed the
levying of the troops. By October 16 an army
of some 10,000 men, under those barons of
the North who were in England, was collected in
Bishop Auckland Park. The Scots were quite
unaware of its proximity, and a marauding column,
under Sir William Douglas, blundered into it on the
evening of the 16th, losing heavily before it could
withdraw. David, young and hot-blooded, at once
resolved to attack, though his swarm of spearmen,
without archers, and weak in heavy cavalry, was at
a great disadvantage beside the English force.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th the English army
was strongly posted on the hills north of Bishop
Auckland. The ground in its front was broken and
intersected by hedges. The Archbishop of York
was on the field, and the banners of the northern
saints, suspended to a great cross, were carried into
action, as they had been at Northallerton two centuries
before. The centre was commanded by Ralph
Neville, the right by Henry Percy and the northern
barons, the left, of Lancashire men, by Thomas of
Rokeby. The Scots advanced in three divisions,
the centre under the King, the right under the Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of Moray, the left under Robert, the High Steward
of Scotland, afterwards the first Stuart King. From
the first everything went ill with the Scots. Entangled
among the enclosures and ditches, their
heavy, cumbrous columns, as at Halidon Hill, were
tormented and disordered by a rain of arrows, to
which they could make no reply. Sir John Graham
in vain charged with a body of horsemen in the
endeavour to ride down the bowmen. He and
his band were all shot down. Seeing the disorder
among their adversaries, the English army came on
to a counter-attack, with the sacred banners waving
in their van. The Scots’ right, striving vainly to
form in order amid the hedges and obstacles, was
charged by the men-at-arms, broken and driven
back in utter rout, with the loss of its leader; the
Steward’s division was forced away, and cut off
from the King, and the whole English force closed
upon the centre. For some three hours the Scots
fought desperately, but their mass was finally pierced
through and shattered, and David himself wounded
and taken prisoner by John of Coupland, a Northumbrian
squire.</p>

<p>Robert the Steward appears to have been accused
of having made no effort to save the King. David
certainly seems to have suspected him; but it must
be said that had he brought up his division again,
he would probably have only added to the greatness
of the disaster. He retreated in tolerable
order, drawing to him as many as possible of the
survivors from the other divisions, and the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
were too weary to pursue. With David were taken
the Archbishop of St. Andrews and several nobles,
while the death-roll included more than thirty
barons, including the Lord Marischal Keith and the
Constable Hay.</p>

<p>This great disaster brought about a cessation of
Scottish invasions for many years. David II.
became more or less Anglicized during his long
residence in England, and Robert the Steward,
both as regent and monarch, was inclined to peace.
The nobles, however, were warlike and turbulent,
and the people did not love England. Several
Border strongholds were still held by the English,
and there was continuous skirmishing on the frontier,
which, however, rarely assumed the dignity of
national strife. The Black Death weakened both
nations, and not until 1377 was the war renewed
in earnest. Berwick-on-Tweed was taken and retaken.
There was fighting on the sea, ending in
the destruction of the Scottish piratical fleet under
Andrew Mercer by the London merchant Philpot.
The English invaded the Lothians more than once
with no permanent results.</p>

<p>In 1385 Jean de Vienne, Admiral of France, landed
in Scotland with 2,000 men-at-arms, 50,000 francs of
gold, and a large supply of arms and armour. A great
invasion of England was organized, and 30,000 men
under De Vienne, James, Earl of Douglas, and other
lords, entered Northumberland. So formidable did
the invasion appear that the young King Richard II.
himself took the command against the Scots. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the disgust of the French, the Scots retreated into
Clydesdale, and, while the English burned Edinburgh,
Perth, and Dundee, made a retaliatory raid
into Cumberland. They did not agree well with
their allies, who, on their side, conceived a great
dislike for the poverty of the country, as well as for
the keenness of the people in respect of monetary
transactions. They went home sulkily, De Vienne
himself being pledge that the cost of their maintenance
should be paid by France. Chance made
the two nations allies, but the French themselves
never seem to have made a good impression in
Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1388 the Scottish nobles arranged&mdash;behind the
King’s back be it noted&mdash;an attack on England
to revenge the devastation of 1385. An army,
vaguely said to have been 40,000 strong, under
Robert, Earl of Fife, the second son of the King,
invaded Cumberland, with the usual negative result;
while a body of about 5,000, under Douglas,
crossed the Tweed, and carried devastation to the
gates of Durham. The Earl of Northumberland
and his son Henry, the celebrated ‘Hotspur,’ were
driven into Newcastle, and Douglas retired unmolested
as far as Otterburn, some twenty miles
from the Border. Here he was overtaken by a
force under ‘Hotspur,’ and a furious engagement
took place, which has been celebrated by Froissart
in prose and in the famous ballad of ‘Chevy Chase.’
In the end the English were beaten off, and Percy
and other knights fell into the hands of the Scots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
who, however, had to lament the death of their
leader.</p>

<p>In the following year Robert II. died. His
feeble son John, ‘Robert III.,’ was anxious to keep
the peace with England, and in this was backed
by his brother and co-regent, Robert, Duke of
Albany. In 1398 the heir-apparent, David, Duke
of Rothesay, supplanted his uncle for a while, and
inaugurated a vigorous anti-English policy. He
alienated the powerful Earl of March by breaking
off his betrothal to his daughter, and March fled to
England. Henry IV. was anxious for peace, but
the Scots appear to have been determined on war,
and he made a brief expedition into Scotland in
1399. In 1402, after much desultory skirmishing,
the Scots, taking advantage of Henry’s preoccupations,
invaded England with a considerable army
under Murdoch, Earl of Fife, son of Albany (who
had overthrown and murdered Rothesay), and
Archibald, Earl of Douglas, grandson of the hero of
Otterburn. They advanced, ravaging in the usual
manner, as far as the Tyne, and then turned homeward,
pursued by a force under ‘Hotspur’ and the
fugitive Earl of March. They were overtaken
while encamped on Homildon, or Humbledon,
Hill, near Wooler. Percy and March, adopting
tactics curiously similar to those employed a century
later almost at the same spot by Surrey, moved
round the Scots’ position, and, by placing themselves
on their line of retreat, forced them to abandon their
booty and disperse, or fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
The battle presents few features of interest; it
was a mere counterpart in tactics of Halidon Hill
and Neville’s Cross. The Scots were tormented
in the old fashion by the archers, and Fife and
Douglas failed to attempt the only possible, if
forlorn, expedient to stay them&mdash;a determined
charge of cavalry. Seeing the increasing disorder,
Sir John Swinton, one of the bravest knights in the
army, begged permission to advance, though only
with his following of 100 lances. Sir Adam
Gordon, his personal enemy, thereupon sought
reconciliation with him, and the erstwhile foes,
embracing on the field, placed themselves at the
head of the band, which rode downhill among the
archers, and perished to the last man. Driven to
desperation by the murderous discharge, the Scottish
masses at last lumbered clumsily down the hill, only
to be massacred by the pitiless arrow flight, until in
despair they broke and fled. The English men-at-arms
hardly struck a blow. Fife and Douglas were
both taken; the latter had received five wounds,
and owed his life solely to his well-tempered
armour.</p>

<p>Disastrous as Homildon had been, it cannot be
said to have any decisive effects. The old frontier
strife went on unchecked. The Scots recovered
Jedburgh, one of the few posts still held by the
English in 1409. A great invasion, organized by
Albany in 1416, ended in a fiasco; and when James I.
returned in 1424 from his captivity in England,
hostilities had almost died away. This was largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
due to the fact that several of the chief Scottish
nobles, including Douglas, had gone to fight in the
service of France against England. The result
was that direct warfare on the Border tended to
die out.</p>

<span class="subhead">1424&ndash;1542</span></h2>

<p>When in 1424 James I., after his long captivity in
England, took over the government of Scotland,
his energies were mainly directed to internal reform,
though he made in 1436 a fruitless attempt to recover
Roxburgh. James II. attacked Berwick in
1455, and raided the Border next year. In 1460
Roxburgh was recovered, though James himself was
killed by a bursting cannon. England, involved in
the Wars of the Roses, could do little. As the
price of assistance rendered to the Lancastrians,
Scotland regained Berwick, which was retained
until 1482, when Prince Richard, afterwards King
Richard III., finally recovered it for England.</p>

<p>For thirty years thereafter a precarious peace
subsisted between the two kingdoms, but dread and
dislike of England were always strong in Scotland,
which was also more or less attached to England’s
old enemy, France. James IV. interfered in the
cause of the adventurer Perkin Warbeck in 1497<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
without effect, and the Earl of Surrey retaliated
by a raid. Hostilities were ended by the Peace
of Ayton. In 1503 James married Henry VII.’s
daughter Margaret.</p>

<p>For ten years the peace subsisted, but the chronic
Border feuds were a constant source of trouble.
Henry was suspicious of the frequent passage
through his realm of Scotsmen proceeding to
France. James was busy endeavouring to form a
navy, and his captains, Andrew and Robert Barton
and Sir Andrew Wood, were often in conflict with
English vessels. It was the rule of those days
that navy ships must support themselves, and the
English, who were often probably little better, regarded
the Scots admirals as pirates. There is
little doubt that they did occasionally behave as such.</p>

<p>Up to 1511 the peace lasted, though the fierce
and resolute Henry VIII. was a more dangerous
neighbour than his father. But in August came an
event which precipitated hostilities. It appears that
Andrew Barton had made prize of English ships,
and Lord Edward Howard, High Admiral of
England, with his brother Thomas, attacked him
as he was cruising in the English Channel. After
a fierce struggle Barton was slain, and his two
ships, the <i class="shipname">Lion</i> and the <i class="shipname">Jennet Perwyn</i>, were taken.
James protested, but Henry haughtily declined to
treat upon a matter of piracy. Yet it seems that
he released the prisoners, and certainly offered to
make fair compensation for the unjustifiable actions
of Englishmen. In May, 1512, Lord Dacre and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Dr. West appeared in Edinburgh, but at the same
time came the French Ambassador, De la Motte,
with instructions to enlist, if possible, Scotland on
the side of France in the impending struggle with
England. The wisdom of making a diversion on
England’s rear was obvious. James informed
Henry that he could consent to no peace which did
not include France. De la Motte came and went
between Paris and Edinburgh, and supplies of all
kinds were sent from France. To James’s romantic
nature Queen Anne’s ring and the message to ‘her
true knight,’ begging him to invade England for
her sake, were perhaps dearer.</p>

<p>On June 30 Henry VIII. crossed to Calais to
invade France, and on July 26 James sent Lyon
King-at-Arms to declare war. A squadron of
thirteen ships, under the Earl of Arran, was sent
into the Irish Sea, perhaps to make a diversion by
attacking Ireland. This attempt was a failure. A
futile attack was made on Carrickfergus, and then
the Scottish fleet disappears from the scene.</p>

<p>The whole fighting population of Scotland was
ordered to assemble on the Boroughmuir of Edinburgh.
To-day the population of England is eight
times that of Scotland. In 1801 it was only five
and a half times as great, and in 1513 the discrepancy
may have been less. Assuming it to
have been the same, and taking the population of
England at 4,000,000, that of Scotland would be
about 700,000, and the number of fighting men
perhaps 100,000; but though this is the figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
given by Hall, it is unlikely that more than 50,000
took the field. The English chronicler would
naturally incline to exaggeration.</p>

<p>Still, the army was the most formidable that
Scotland had ever sent forth. Thanks to France,
the Lowlanders were well equipped as regards
defensive armour. Hall says that the English
arrows had less effect than of old. The Highlanders
however, as a whole, lacked mail and
consequently efficiency; and the Borderers were
unstable and turbulent, and attached more importance
to pillage than fighting. The grand Lowland
foot-spearmen were, as ever, the backbone of the
army, but it lacked anything like a proper proportion
of archers and arquebusiers. The artillery was
largely composed of fine cast pieces, the work of
Robert Borthwick, James’s famous master-gunner.
It appears to have included some forty guns in all,
but there were few trained artillerymen.</p>

<p>To cover his concentration, James ordered a raid
into Northumberland under Lord Home, High
Chamberlain of Scotland and Warden of all the
Marches. Home has gained a bad reputation in the
annals of his country, but it would seem that his
fault was not treachery, but mere lack of military
capacity. He collected a force estimated by the
English writers&mdash;probably with exaggeration&mdash;at
7,000 men, and did much damage; but on his retreat
he was overtaken by a small English force under
Sir William Bulmer at Milfield-on-Till, and routed
with a loss of 1,000 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Henry, to use Hall’s quaint language, had not
forgotten ‘y<sup>e</sup> olde pranks of y<sup>e</sup> Scottes,’ and had
made dispositions for the adequate defence of
the realm during his absence. His general in
the north was Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey,
Lord Treasurer and High Marshal of England,
a veteran nearly seventy years of age, who had
fought for Richard III. at Bosworth, but had
become reconciled to the new conditions and
commanded against James sixteen years before.
Henry was undoubtedly wise in leaving him to
watch over England, but the old warrior himself
was disappointed at losing a chance of distinguishing
himself in France. He grumbled in good
English fashion, and growled that, if James did
invade, he should meet more than he had bargained
for. ‘Sory may I se hym or I dye that is the cause
of mye abydynge behynde, and if ever hee and I
mete, I shall doe that inne mee lyeth to make hyme
as sory if I canne.’ In July, as the danger became
more imminent, he established himself at Pontefract
to organize the defence of the north. The efficacy
of his measures is apparent in the remarkable rapidity
of his concentration.</p>

<p>On August 22 the Scottish army occupied Twisel,
and on the following day began the siege of Norham,
which had often defied the strength of Scotland in
bygone days. But James brought his guns to bear
upon the walls, and breaches soon began to appear.
The garrison fought desperately and repelled three
assaults, but, in the effort to keep down the Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
cannonade, rapidly expended their stock of ammunition.
On the 29th, without further means of defence,
the castle surrendered. This was a considerable
success for James, and was improved by the capture
of Etal and Ford Castles. The next object of attack
would probably have been Berwick, but already the
English Army of the North was on the way. James
therefore took up a strong position west of the Till,
and awaited attack, his own quarters being for some
days at Ford. Round this latter circumstance has
gathered the time-honoured but baseless legend that
he wasted weeks in dalliance with Lady Heron.</p>

<p>Surrey heard of the Scottish advance on August 25,
and promptly ordered his forces to assemble at Newcastle.
He directed his son Thomas, who commanded
the fleet on the coast, to join him with his
marines. On September 1 he advanced, but the
weather was so bad that not until the 3rd did he
reach Alnwick, where he halted to close up. On the
4th the Admiral joined with 1,000 men. The army
was now 26,000 strong.</p>

<p>Surrey organized his force in two corps. The
Vanguard was commanded by the Admiral, who
led his main body in person, with his brother
Edmund in charge of his right wing and the venerable
Sir Marmaduke Constable<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> leading his left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
The Rearguard was under Surrey’s personal control.
Lord Dacre led its right wing, composed mainly of
Border horsemen; and Sir Edward Stanley its left,
consisting chiefly of the fine archers of Lancashire
and Cheshire. The artillery train was under Sir
Nicholas Appleyard. For the last time the famous
banner of St. Cuthbert was carried into action.</p>

<p>On September 6 Surrey reached Wooler, ‘three
lytel miles, from the King of Scots,’ says Hall.
Counting upon James’s reputation for rash chivalry,
he sent him a formal challenge to fight on the 9th.
The Admiral added a provocative message of his
own, informing James that he was there in person
to answer for the death of Barton. All this
‘quarrelling by the book’ was quite in the style
of the times, a fact which Mr. Andrew Lang and
other modern writers who have commented upon
the ‘insolence’ of the Howards, appear to have
forgotten.</p>

<p>The Scots were encamped upon a mass of hilly
ground lying three miles above the junction of
the Glen with the Till. The southern portion of
this mass is roughly circular at the base, from two
to three miles across in every direction and 700 feet
high. On the north and north-east it sinks somewhat
sharply 400 feet to a valley, across which a
saddleback runs to a second mass, roughly quadrangular,
nearly four miles long and two in breadth.
The western portion is 800 feet high; Barley Hill,
the southern spur, is 582; Flodden Edge, on the
north-east, overlooking the Till, is 509. The northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
spur is called Branxton Hill; it drops from 500 feet
to 227 feet at Branxton Church, just below.</p>

<p>If only three miles separated the armies, the Scots
must have been stationed on the southern mass,
between Milfield and Kirknewton. The artillery
was at the foot of the slope. On the 7th there was
a distant cannonade, but no further fighting. The
Scottish position was far too strong to be attacked.
On the 8th, therefore, Surrey moved to his right
across the Till to Barmoor. He was, so Hall says,
only two miles from the Scottish front. This must
mean that the English outposts on the ridge between
Ford and Doddington were about two miles from
the Till. The English main army, however, was
behind the ridge, out of view of the Scots.</p>

<p>From the ridge&mdash;perhaps the part above Fordwood&mdash;Surrey
and his son reconnoitred James’s
position. Holinshed says that it was the Admiral
who advised his father to make a turning movement
across Twisel Bridge, and so plant himself on the
Scottish communications. Hall, who is very detailed
as to the Admiral’s doings, does not say so; in any
case, the decision rested with Surrey. The momentous
resolution was taken, and at daybreak the
English army marched for Twisel.</p>

<div id="ip_258" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>PLAN OF THE FLODDEN MANŒUVRE.</p>

<p class="subcap">Showing the English flank march behind the screen of hills.</p></div></div>

<p>The Scots committed a fatal blunder in leaving
Twisel Bridge unguarded. It can, of course, be
said for them that strategy so bold as that of Surrey
was almost unheard of in mediæval warfare. But
there does not appear to have been a picket at the
bridge, nor does any attempt seem to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
made to keep in touch with the English army by
means of the light Border moss-troopers. Either
the Scottish leaders were incapable of penetrating
a skilful but hazardous design, or the Borderers were
surprisingly useless for scouting.</p>

<p>From Barmoor to Twisel Bridge is about nine
miles. Wet weather had rendered the tracks
very difficult, and progress was doubtless slow.
Hall also says that the English were starving, but
this statement cannot be accepted; the vigour with
which they acted sufficiently disproves it. The
bridge was found unguarded, and the Vanguard
began to stream across. The artillery train followed.
The Rearguard appears to have crossed chiefly by
Mill Ford, a mile above Twisel. As the armies
were not in contact until about 4 p.m., it cannot be
doubted that the passage was not detected by the
Scots until after midday.</p>

<p>The Scottish army was probably watching the
line of the Till above Ford, with its artillery at
the foot of its strong position. Its order of battle
can only be surmised. The common idea that it
was ill supplied seems to be baseless; the Bishop
of Durham, who had means of knowing, stated that
the Scottish camps were full of provisions. France
had sent shiploads of supplies, and the army had
only been eighteen days in the field. Assuming
that James had commenced the campaign with
50,000 men, he must still have had 40,000 at least.</p>

<p>The Scottish scouts appear to have interpreted
the English movement as a counter-invasion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Scotland, and so it was reported to James. Tents
were hurriedly struck and parked, and the unwieldy
host proceeded to change front to the north. The
varied and undisciplined character of the Scottish
army must have rendered the complicated manœuvre
slow and difficult. It is possible that James intended
to recross the Tweed at Coldstream in order to deal
with the supposed invasion. On the other hand, it
is probable that Surrey hoped to encamp for the
night on Branxton Hill, and not to engage until
next day.</p>

<p>About 3.30 p.m. the English Vanguard was passing
Branxton Church. The Scots were still scattered
over the upland in five great masses, three of which
were moving over Branxton Hill. A division under
Lords Home and Huntly was leading on the
left; next came another under the Earls of Crawford
and Montrose. On its right rear was the centre,
under King James, with Lord Sinclair in command
of the artillery. The Earl of Bothwell’s division,
and the Highlanders under the Earls of Lennox and
Argyll, were still far behind. The English order of
battle has already been given. There was a considerable
interval between the Vanguard and Rearguard.
The artillery was with the Vanguard.</p>

<p>James, seeing from the heights the English passing
Branxton, ordered the rubbish in the camps to be
fired, that the acrid smoke, borne on the south-west
breeze, might drive in the face of the foe, and under
cover of it the three Scottish divisions began to
advance. Probably the smoke confused them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
well; it must have put the English on the alert.
Still, the silent advance was to some extent a surprise.
As the English van reached the Branxton brook
the smoke cleared away, and they saw the Scottish
‘battles’ bristling with pikes in their front. The
peril was imminent. Taking the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agnus Dei</i> from
his neck, Lord Thomas sent it to his father, begging
him to hasten into line, and hurriedly fronted up the
Vanguard. The artillery, coming into action on the
left, pounded furiously at the Scots pouring down
the hill.</p>

<p>Howard’s bold show had good effects. James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
halted to allow his guns to come into action, but
Borthwick’s beautiful pieces, worked by ill-trained
gunners, and badly placed on a slippery hillside,
were rapidly silenced or dismounted. Lord Sinclair
was slain directing his batteries, and the English
guns soon gained the complete mastery. Then
Surrey hurried into line with his son, and James’s
great opportunity was gone. The English main-battle
closed up on the Admiral and Constable;
Dacre took post behind Howard; Sir Edward
Stanley was hurrying to form on Surrey’s left. The
English fire was directed with deadly effect on the
heavy masses of the Scottish centre; the Scottish
artillery was almost all out of action. Much has
been said of the rashness of the Scots in charging,
but in truth there was little alternative.</p>

<p>At first, all went well for Scotland. Home and
Huntly bore down on Edmund Howard’s division,
while Crawford and Montrose charged the Admiral.
The two English divisions became separated from
one another, and Lord Edmund’s was completely
broken and scattered, though he himself cut his way
through a body of Homes,<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> who endeavoured to stay
him, and joined his brother. The success of Home
and Huntly was locally complete; but they could
not control their undisciplined followers, many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" class="hidev">265</a></span>
whom scattered to plunder. Dacre hurried up his
reserves, and, though his Bamboroughshire and
Tynemouth troops wavered and broke, succeeded
in checking the Chamberlain’s advance, and kept
him at bay throughout the battle.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H" id="Footnote_H" href="#FNanchor_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> This body was commanded by Sir David Home, the father

probably the rallying-point of this unfortunate detachment. After
the fight it is said to have served as Sir David’s winding-sheet.</p></div>

<p>The Scottish centre, moving down the hill, was
met with a hail of cannon-balls and arrows, but
the sturdy yeomen came on with the finest spirit,
doffing their shoes to obtain firmer footing, never
halting or wavering. They closed upon the English
centre, despite its heavy fire, and under the weight
and impetus of the charge it was forced backward.
But it was not broken, and the fight raged fiercely
along the line, James and his picked troops making
repeated and desperate attempts to pierce the stubborn
English front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
The non-arrival of Bothwell and the Highlanders
left James’s right entirely uncovered, and Sir Edward
Stanley, coming up from the Mill Ford, was directed
against it. His left reached the crown of Branxton
Hill without meeting any foe, but before he could
develop his attack he was charged by the Highlanders,
who had at last arrived, while Bothwell
passed behind them down the slope to support the
King.</p>

<p>It was bow against claymore. Again and again
the wild Highlanders, stripped to their shirts after
their fashion, ‘like wave with crest of sparkling
foam,’ hurled themselves with fiery impulse upon
Stanley’s division&mdash;in vain. Their desperate courage
availed nothing against the deadly arrow flight of
the best archers of England and, after both their
earls had fallen, they broke and fled westward over
the space on which the Scottish centre had stood,
leaving the hillside heaped with slain.</p>

<p>Somewhere about the same time, as it would
seem, the Admiral had succeeded in breaking the
division of Crawford and Montrose; the earls had
fallen, and their followers were streaming away to
the rear, and becoming intermingled with the
fleeing Highlanders. The sight of the crowd of
fugitives cannot but have had a fatal effect upon
such troops as Home and Huntly had succeeded in
keeping together. Howard turned the bulk of his
victorious division against the uncovered left of the
Scots’ centre, while Stanley wheeled round upon its
right and rear.</p>

<p>These movements decided the battle. The
Scottish centre and Bothwell’s division were probably
equal in number to the troops that assailed
them; but they were practically surrounded, destitute
of artillery, and with few arquebusiers and
archers to respond to the steady fire from the
English guns, matchlocks, and
bows, while the unwieldy
dimensions and density of
their defensive formation
made manœuvring impossible.
Possibly the mass made endeavours
to move to its left,
but for all practical purposes
it was stationary, and nothing
was left to the gallant spearmen
but to fight to the last.
King James was in the front
rank, and so long as he lived
he never ceased to lead
desperate attempts to break
the English line. If he was
no general, at least he wielded
his ‘vain knight-errant’s brand’
as became a king. Wounded
again and again, he was slain at last, within a few
yards of where his aged opponent sat in his chariot<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a>
directing the battle. Still his followers fought on
desperately. Scott has told the story of their great
stand in glowing verse. The last stages of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
battle must have taken place in ever-growing
gloom, and when there was no longer light to direct
the charges Surrey drew off his troops. Under
cover of night the Scottish centre, shattered and
broken, but unconquered still, struggled away to
Coldstream and so across Tweed, to tell Scotland
the story of disaster.</p>

<p>The English passed the night in bivouac on the
field. All around the Borderers of both armies
were plundering indiscriminately, stripping the
dead, and committing, doubtless, nameless atrocities.
They impartially made prize of Surrey’s tents and
baggage and the Scottish artillery oxen, for want
of which nearly the whole train had to be abandoned.
When morning came it was seen that the
Scots’ centre had disappeared. Home had got
some of his troops in hand again, and was in line
towards the west, perhaps covering the retreat of
the centre. His demoralized and half-hearted men
were scattered by artillery fire, and drifted away
across Tweed; and then Surrey could take stock
of his victory. On the slope of Branxton Hill the
victors found dead the King of Scots, his natural
son Alexander, Archbishop of St. Andrews, two
bishops, two mitred abbots, twelve earls, fourteen
lords, and hundreds of scions of every noble house
in Scotland. The whole Scottish loss can hardly
have been less than 10,000; the unmailed Highlanders
had been mown down in thousands. The
English superiority in troops armed with missile
weapons must have had terrible results; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
should be remembered that as a rule quarter was
neither asked for nor given. The English put their
own losses as low as 1,500. Except in Edmund
Howard’s division, they must have been far lower
in proportion than those of the Scots; perhaps
4,000 in all is a fair estimate. Prisoners in such a
conflict could not have been numerous; the only
definite record is that of about sixty taken by
the Scottish left wing. Surrey took possession
of nearly all the Scottish artillery: five ‘great
drakes’ (? 24-pounders), seven ‘great culverins’
(18-pounders), four ‘sakers’ (5-pounders), and six
‘serpentines’ (? 4-pounders)&mdash;all beautiful brass
pieces wrought by Borthwick’s skilled hand&mdash;besides
light guns.<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_J" id="Footnote_J" href="#FNanchor_J" class="fnanchor">J</a> Hall gives the total of large pieces at seventeen, including
two culverins; but Holinshed says that the ‘Seven Sisters’ were
all taken, and it is most unlikely that the Scots could have saved
any of these heavy guns.</p></div>

<p>So ended the Battle of Flodden. On the Scots’
side it was a magnificent display of fruitless courage,
very little aided by military skill. On the part of
England, all the commanders on the field worked
together as one man to gain the victory; and though
some of the hasty county levies showed unsteadiness,
on the whole they admirably seconded their leaders.
The boldness of Surrey’s strategy is remarkable in
such an aged man. Napoleon was emphatically of
opinion that military leaders lose their boldness with
advancing age. Tried by this standard, the only
modern leader who can challenge comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Surrey is Suvórov, whose greatest triumphs were
gained when he was almost seventy.</p>

<p>In Scotland the tendency has been to throw the
blame for the catastrophe upon Lord Home. That
his Borderers and Huntly’s Highlanders largely
dispersed after their successful charge is no doubt
true; but seeing how entirely unstable and unreliable
they always were in battle, the chiefs can hardly be
blamed. After Flodden Home became a partisan
of the English alliance, and has therefore been condemned
by many writers who regard his action from
a narrowly patriotic standpoint. He was clearly not
a man of military ability, but there is no reason to
doubt that he did his duty. Lord Dacre’s letter to
his Government, dated May 17, 1514, effectually
disposes of the idea that Home looked on at the
defeat of the Scottish centre and right. It was
unfortunate for him that he survived the battle only
to be put out of the way by the Regent Albany
three years later.</p>

<p>Flodden as regards the courage displayed on the
field was honourable to both nations. In a sense it
was a decisive battle, for it seems to have brought
home to public opinion in Scotland that the country
might do better than sacrifice itself for France.
There were no more great invasions of England.
In 1522, and again in the following year, the
Scottish nobles refused point-blank to cross the
Border against England. But James V. was still
disposed to adhere to the French alliance, and
Henry VIII.’s somewhat truculent diplomacy did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
not tend to improve matters. With brief intervals
of truce, the weary Border warfare went on for many
years. James’s marriage to Marie de Lorraine in
1538 accentuated his leaning to France. In 1542,
in order to make a diversion in favour of François I.,
James drifted into open war. A small English force
invaded Scotland, but was badly beaten at Haddon
Rigg in Teviotdale. A larger expedition under the
Duke of Norfolk (the Admiral of Flodden) was more
successful, but had no great results.</p>

<p>To cope with Norfolk, James collected a large
army on Fala Muir. Finding that Norfolk had
already retired, he would have invaded England;
but once more the nobles declined to rush into
disaster for the sake of France. Bitterly mortified,
James fell back on the assistance of the great
Churchmen, upon whom his Gallicizing policy chiefly
depended, and raised a new army, variously estimated
at from 10,000 to 18,000 men strong. On
November 24 it crossed the Border north of Carlisle.
The result was the disaster of Solway Moss, the most
melancholy affair in Scottish military annals.</p>

<p>James himself did not accompany his army, but
remained at Lochmaben. It was thus without a
responsible commander, and not apparently until
the last moment was it announced that the King’s
choice was Sir Oliver Sinclair, Standard-Bearer of
Scotland. The effect was disastrous. The nobles
present were exasperated at being placed under a
mere knight, whose only distinction was that he was
his master’s favourite, and the army became an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
incoherent mass of ill-disciplined contingents without
a responsible head. In this condition the Scots
were attacked by the English. Sir Thomas Wharton,
Deputy-Warden of the Western Marches, had
collected 3,000 men at Carlisle; and informed by
Thomas, a bastard Dacre, and ‘Jacke’ of Musgrave,
of the state of the Scots, advanced against them.</p>

<p>The demoralized Scottish force was in a very
dangerous position. Some miles behind them were
the Esk and the dangerous bogs of Solway Moss.
Their van was charged by a detachment of English
cavalry and thrown into disorder, and then the
whole army, as it seems, began to retreat in a
huddled mass to the Esk. In vain the nobles
present endeavoured to rally their followers, and
dismounted to set them an example. ‘In a shake
all the way,’ the demoralized Scots crowded back
towards the only point of passage across the Esk,
a narrow ford near the hill of Arthuret. The confusion
grew worse and worse: prisoners were taken
and men lost in the marshes. At the ford every
trace of order was lost, and the English, making a
final charge, thrust the army into the river and
Solway Moss. The rout was piteous. Only twenty
men are said to have been slain in fight, but hundreds
were drowned and suffocated in the bogs; and 1,200
prisoners taken, including the unfortunate Sinclair,
two earls, five barons, and hundreds of gentlemen.
Twenty-four cannon, the Royal Standard of Scotland,
and all the Scots’ baggage fell into the hands
of the victors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Solway Moss was the cause of the premature
death of James V., and more than ever must have
convinced the Scots that the French alliance was the
ruin of the country. But the blundering violence of
England roused the spirit of the nation, and repeated
harryings of Lothian and the disastrous defeat of
Pinkie only fired its stubborn pride. For thirty
years, thanks to the blunders of her rulers, England
was still to have Scotland as a potential enemy.
But after 1550 hostilities practically ceased, and the
growing strength of Protestantism in Scotland drew
the two countries slowly together. The Border
disturbances gradually died down; the presence of
French mercenaries taught the Scottish Protestants
that French domination was more to be feared than
that of England. After the expulsion of Mary, a
succession of rulers worked steadily towards a closer
friendship with England, and when the last and
greatest of the Tudors ended her life, the sceptre
which she had wielded so well passed quietly to the
King of Scotland.</p>

<p>While the Scottish invasions were a perpetual
menace to the peace of the North, they cannot
be said, in the slightest degree, to have really
threatened the national stability. Man for man,
Scot and Englishman were well matched, and
in minor frays, in which individual and reckless
courage counted for much, the honours were fairly
divided. In the great invasions the political and
economic conditions in Scotland were never sufficiently
favourable to allow of the formation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
properly organized and equipped army large enough
to make a serious impression. The most effective
Scottish invasions were those of Robert Bruce, but
the most dangerous of these only penetrated as far
as York. After Halidon Hill had taught the
English generals what an effective weapon they
possessed in their archery, they never hesitated to
give battle, however great might be the odds
against them.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SPANISH ARMADA</span>

<span class="subhead">1588</span></h2>

<p>The Spanish attacks upon England during the
reign of Elizabeth were hardly invasions in the
strict sense of the word, since only once was a small
force actually landed. Nevertheless, they cannot
be ignored, if only for the reason that they came
nearer to effecting a landing in force than any other
of England’s oversea foes since that period. They
furnish the spectacle of a remarkable display of
patience and ill-directed determination, brought to
nought by the might of sea power, happily guided at
the critical moment by the first of England’s modern
scientific admirals. Finally, it is not generally
realized that more than one attack was made.</p>

<p>‘To Castille and to Leon, Colón [Columbus]
gave a new world,’ but his gift was to be the ruin
of Spain. The preposterous papal decree which
divided all the new discoveries between Spain and
Portugal was hardly likely to be respected by
powerful states like France and England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
It was the French who led the way. The
Franco-Spanish wars of the sixteenth century gave
them their opportunity, and the fine seamen of
Normandy, Brittany, and La Rochelle began to
harry the ports of the West Indies. Matters
became worse when the persecuted French Protestants
took to the sea. In 1553 Sores, a
Huguenot captain, with the help of escaped negro
slaves, sacked all the chief Spanish settlements
except San Domingo. The corsairs were assisted
by the utter rottenness of the Spanish colonial
system. It was also in their favour that the social
organization of Spain was still completely mediæval,
and that mercantile and trade interests were entirely
subordinated to those of the military aristocracy.</p>

<p>The English came later. The relations between
England and Spain were for long friendly, and
their commercial intercourse was of old standing.
But after the Reformation the religious factor came
to complicate the situation. Though the Governments
strove to maintain peace, the Protestant
rovers from the West Country preyed on Spanish
commerce, and the Holy Inquisition ignored all the
laws of nations in its treatment of heretic seamen.
Nor was it in human nature to stand idly and see
the trade of half the world monopolized by two
countries merely on the authority of a papal bull.
The colonists themselves were quite willing to
trade, and English merchants soon began to endeavour
to establish markets. To describe them as
pirates is totally inaccurate, but the Spanish officials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
did not&mdash;perhaps in their ignorance could not&mdash;realize
the comparative innocence of the English
merchants. In 1568 John Hawkins, the most prominent
of the pioneers, was treacherously attacked in
the Mexican port of San Juan de Ulua by the
Viceroy and Francisco de Luxan, General of the
Fleet of New Spain. The result was to deeply
embitter the relations of the two Powers, and
thenceforth English seamen went to the West
Indies determined, since the Spaniards would not
trade, to make their profit out of them otherwise.</p>

<p>At sea the two states were most unequally matched.
The power of Spain on land was great, but her
strength at sea has been ludicrously misrepresented.
Spain at this time had no sea-going navy at all! In
the Mediterranean she had some 100 war-galleys,
but galleys were useless for ocean work. On the
other hand, England had, for the time, a considerable
Royal Navy, and the number of armed merchantmen
liable for service in time of war was very large.
Portugal had a considerable oceanic squadron. But
Spain, for two generations, was content to leave her
Atlantic trade entirely unprotected, until the depredations
of the French corsairs forced the situation
upon the notice of her Government.</p>

<p>It was Pero Menendez de Aviles, perhaps the
greatest of all Spanish seamen, who goaded his slow-moving
and short-sighted Government into creating
an oceanic navy. Menendez was a fanatically religious
man, and regarding, as he did, the heretic
corsairs as the enemies of mankind, he was frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
guilty of acts of ferocious cruelty. That he, as
sincerely as his English antitype Francis Drake,
believed himself to be the chosen instrument of
Heaven cannot be doubted; but he certainly lacked
Drake’s kindly nature.</p>

<p>In 1555 Menendez is found with an armed squadron
guarding the trade fleets. He built at his own cost
three ‘galleons’&mdash;the battleships of the day&mdash;and in
1561 was appointed Captain-General of the Indian
Trade. The French were checked, and by strenuous
endeavour something had been done when the
English appeared on the scene. The Huguenots,
driven from the West Indian Islands, established
themselves at St. Augustine in Florida. Menendez’s
untiring energy pursued them there, and in 1565
the colony was wiped out. Menendez’s grim cruelty
was bitterly remembered. The Spanish Government,
now beginning to rouse itself, issued orders that the
principal vessels of the trade fleets were always
to be armed, and twelve galleons were built for
further protection, for the maintenance of which a
special tax was levied on the Indies merchants.
These galleons were the beginnings of the Spanish
oceanic navy.</p>

<p>The Spanish sea-service was full of grave defects.
A Spanish warship was commanded by a military
officer, whose special charge was the soldiery;
gunnery was neglected and the seamen treated
like galley-slaves. In these circumstances the
Spanish galleon was comparatively ineffective against
ships provided with good guns and gunners. Spain’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
seafaring population, also, was not large, and since it
was impossible to commandeer and arm a powerful
force of her own merchant ships on an emergency,
the Government was wont to seize foreign ships for
the purpose, whose crews naturally embraced every
opportunity of deserting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the English Navy was the
natural product of seafaring instincts. It was not
the outcome of policy, and was ruled by no jealously
devised legal code comparable to that of Louis XIV.
of France. It grew up almost imperceptibly without
any clear conception of the process. The old feudal
traditions gave way slowly, and in 1588 they still so
far prevailed that a noble had to be made nominal
Commander-in-Chief over the head of Drake, though,
thanks to both, no disaster followed. But there has
usually been a spirit of comradeship in English armaments
largely or entirely lacking elsewhere, and this
spirit was beginning to be felt under Elizabeth.</p>

<p>During the early years of Elizabeth there was a
tendency to neglect the Royal Navy. The country
was so strong in privateers and merchant craft
available for war, and so devoid were her possible
antagonists, France and Spain, of true naval power,
that little was done. But about 1570 the news of
Menendez’s untiring efforts brought about a new
shipbuilding programme under the direction of
John Hawkins, who in 1569 became Treasurer of
the Navy. Several new ships were built under his
supervision, and were the most formidable fighting
engines that had yet appeared on the seas. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
were of moderate size, but very seaworthy, heavily
armed, and almost entirely lacking the high fore-and-stern
castles which had encumbered the earlier
vessels. In 1574 a Spanish agent, reporting to his
Government, noted their great fighting value.</p>

<p>The word ‘galleon’ has been frequently misinterpreted.
The galleon was a ship fit for ocean work,
built with something of the fine lines of a galley&mdash;hence
its name. The very long, narrow, lightly-built
galley was useless in the Atlantic; on the
other hand, the short, broad, oceanic trading vessels
were too slow and unwieldy to be of use in war.
Trimming between these two extremes, the French
shipwrights evolved a vessel at once seaworthy and
comparatively fast, and the model was adopted by
England and the Peninsular States. Its essential
characteristics were that it was three beams or
more long, with a draft two-fifths of its beam. By
an extraordinary series of misconceptions the galleon
has come to be regarded as a heavy, clumsy vessel
peculiar to Spain. As a fact, Spain was perhaps
the last of the great Powers of the sixteenth century
to adopt it. This conclusion has been very convincingly
set forth by Mr. Julian Corbett in his
‘Drake and the Tudor Navy.’</p>

<p>In 1574, Philip II., whose bigotry and absolutist
tendencies had created a terrible enemy to Spain
in her Netherland possessions, began to collect a
fleet of light vessels at Santander. The Duke
of Alva had failed in the Low Countries, and
had been succeeded by Don Luis de Requesens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
who found that he could do nothing while Admiral
Boisot and his flotillas held the sea. The command
of the force at Santander was conferred upon Pero
Menendez de Aviles, and by the summer it was
nearly ready to sail. There were 24 large ships
and 188 light vessels of various classes, manned by
12,000 men. Menendez, impressed by the danger
in the Atlantic, was anxious to do something more
than merely support Requesens. He conceived the
design of seizing the Scillies and Falmouth Haven,
and occupying them as naval stations. In this way
he hoped, with his powerful force, to be able at once
to intercept the privateers at the outset of their
Atlantic voyage, and establish a solid check upon
England.</p>

<p>Though Requesens himself was aware of the
danger of provoking England, Philip gave his
assent. On Elizabeth’s side the now reorganized
Royal Navy was prepared for mobilization, together
with some fifty sail of armed merchantmen. But
so great was the dissension in the Council that
Requesens told Menendez that he could sail up the
Channel unopposed. The attempt, made in the
teeth of England’s sea-power, would probably have
failed in the end; yet it might easily have had
grave results, and Menendez was a commander
of real genius. But he died in the midst of his
final preparations, and so much had the armament
depended upon his single dominating personality
that it broke up.</p>

<p>Thus a great danger to England passed away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
with the man who perhaps of all was best fitted
to direct an attack upon her; and, as Mr. Julian
Corbett points out, it is worthy of note that almost
at the moment when the greatest of the Spanish
ocean admirals vanishes from the scene, Francis
Drake, the protagonist on the English side, comes
to the front.</p>

<p>For ten years after the death of Menendez
peace nominally subsisted between England and
Spain, but it was a peace that was violated every
day. England, officially and unofficially, continued
to assist the revolted Netherlands, and to raid
Spanish and Portuguese commerce. It became
an everyday affair for young Englishmen who
wanted some fighting to slip across to the Low
Countries. Philip countenanced plots against
Elizabeth, and intrigued in England and Ireland.
The exiled Queen Mary of Scotland was an ever-present
source of danger. Above all, the religious
side of the struggle became accentuated as time
went on. In no man was militant Protestantism
more incarnate than in Drake. In 1577
Elizabeth permitted him to sail on his famous
raid on the Spanish Pacific Settlements, and his
striking success was a new stay to the war-party.
He became at once the leading figure on the
English side.</p>

<p>In 1580 the King of Portugal died, and Philip
at once seized his country, forcing Prince Antonio,
the last (illegitimate) scion of the House of Avis,
to flee to England. Terceira, in the Azores, held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
out for some years; but in 1583 it was reduced
by Philip’s famous Admiral, Alvaro de Bazan,
Marques de Santa Cruz, after a naval victory off
St. Michael’s. The possession of Portugal and its
colonies vastly enhanced Philip’s power. The most
important acquisition was that of the Portuguese
Navy&mdash;eleven fine galleons, besides galleys and
small craft. The Spanish Empire was now for the
first time a real naval power.</p>

<p>After his reduction of Terceira, Santa Cruz wrote
to Philip. He suggested that his victorious squadron
should be made the nucleus of a great fleet, and an
attempt made to settle the English Question. His
suggestions, if acted upon, would have meant the
assembly of a far larger force than did actually sail
against England five years later. Santa Cruz
thoroughly understood that the English power was
very formidable. Philip did not see his way to
immediate action, but he issued orders in accordance
with his Admiral’s suggestions. They were only
very partially carried out, but something was done,
and in this way began the ‘Enterprise of England.’</p>

<p>Certain aspects of the situation must be carefully
held in mind. England and Spain, though still
nominally at peace, were being steadily drawn into
war by religious feeling, the jealously exclusive
trade policy of Spain, and the determination of the
English to thwart it. Philip, despite his religious
fanaticism, was very loth to plunge into a war that
was clearly against his interests, since the deposition
of Elizabeth would mean the accession to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
English throne of the half-French Mary Stuart.
England, under Mary, might become by dint of
sword and stake Roman Catholic in faith, but would
lean to France in policy. The Pope believed that
Philip must perforce conquer England, but Philip
thought that he could gain the upper hand at sea
without wiping England off the map. Though he
was clumsily putting Santa Cruz’s precepts into
practice and conniving at plots against Elizabeth,
he did not wish for war, nor was he ready.</p>

<p>On her side Elizabeth personally desired peace.
Sir James Crofts, the Controller of the Household,
was Spain’s paid spy. The Lord Treasurer,
Burghley, was a man of peace, and especially
detested the&mdash;technically&mdash;dubious means by which
the war-party and its instruments were teaching the
world that Spain was but ‘a colossus stuffed with
clouts.’ He entirely failed to see that religious
ardour had cleft an impassable chasm between the
nations, quite apart from the formidable trade
question. The real force which was driving
England into war was the intense Protestant (or
Puritan) feeling of a great part of the nation, of
which the war-party in the Royal Council&mdash;Walsingham,
Leicester, Hatton, and others&mdash;were
the chief exponents, and whose strongest helper
was the famous seaman, Sir Francis Drake. The
London merchants, however, to a considerable
extent, were opposed to war.</p>

<p>In 1585 an egregious blunder on Philip’s part
precipitated hostilities. There had been a failure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
harvest in the Biscayan provinces. Under special
safe-conduct a fleet of English corn-ships sailed to
relieve the distress, but once in port they were all
seized and the crews imprisoned. One ship, the
<i class="shipname">Primrose</i>, of London, escaped, carrying off with her
the Corregidor (Sheriff) of Biscay, who had endeavoured
to seize her. On the Biscayan official
were found his directions, proving beyond all doubt
that Spain was really preparing to invade England.</p>

<p>The country now was resolute for war, and
Elizabeth determined to give Philip a sharp lesson.
A fleet of royal and private ships, commanded by
Drake, was ordered to sail to the rescue. Philip
had already released the ships, apparently because
he realized that the action had been a blunder, but
this made no difference to Drake. On September
27 he appeared off Vigo, and for more than
a week blockaded the port, extorting from the
humiliated and helpless local authorities all that
he needed, and plundering in the neighbourhood.
Then he went on to the Canaries and the West
Indies. Santa Cruz was ordered to prepare a
squadron to pursue him, but not for six months
could he sail; and Drake sacked Santiago in the
Cape Verd Islands, San Domingo, Carthagena, and
St. Augustine in the Spanish Main, returning in
triumph to England in the summer of 1586.</p>

<p>After this open defiance, war seemed inevitable,
and nothing but the strange diplomacy of those days
still deferred it. Elizabeth was, at last, interfering
officially in the Netherlands. In 1586 the ‘Babington’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Plot was discovered, and its result was the
execution of Mary Stuart in 1587. One of Philip’s
deterring motives was thus obviated. By 1587 the
work on the Armada was in full swing, when Elizabeth
again let Drake loose with a powerful squadron.
On April 18 he broke into Cadiz Harbour, worked
havoc with the store-ships which crowded it, and
came out again in spite of all that the Spaniards
could do. Then, with magnificent strategic insight,
he stationed himself off Cape St. Vincent, and threw
the entire Spanish mobilization into utter disorder.
Santa Cruz and Admiral de Recalde in the
Tagus could not move, and were cut off from the
other Spanish squadrons in Cadiz and elsewhere.
For a month Drake held his ground, and when
forced to leave his station, owing to disease in his
insanitary ships, he sailed to the Azores and captured
one of Philip’s great trading carracks, with a cargo
worth £110,000, or about £800,000 in modern value.
He said that his cruise had singed Philip’s beard.
In fact, it had dislocated all the Spanish plans, and
done damage to the amount of millions of ducats.</p>

<p>Had the blow been followed up, Philip’s scattered
squadrons could hardly have concentrated. But
Elizabeth now fell into a fit of indecision, which was
encouraged by the unscrupulous Crofts, who actually
suggested that for his services Drake should be
disgraced and his property confiscated!</p>

<p>After Drake’s return, the Spanish preparations
were able, slowly and painfully, to go forward.
The Prince of Parma, Philip’s General in the Netherlands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
said afterwards that had the Armada sailed
in September, it would have encountered no opposition.
But the point is that it did not sail, and that
the English Government was well informed of
its backward state of preparation. Santa Cruz was
still at sea hunting for Drake, who was already safe
at home, and he did not return until September. By
that time the Spanish squadrons were at Lisbon
under General de Leyva, but still in a very unready
state, while Santa Cruz’s vessels needed a complete
refit. After repeated efforts, the Marquis succeeded
in inducing the King to defer the expedition until
March. But he was broken by anxiety and thankless
toil, harassed by unjust attacks, and early in
1588 died. His death robbed the expedition of
most of its chances of success.</p>

<p>At Santa Cruz’s death the Armada was still hopelessly
unready. Guns, ammunition, food&mdash;everything
was wanting. The men were unpaid, ragged, and
often dying of hunger. According to feudal notions,
the command of so great an expedition must be
given to a great prince, and a harmless Spanish
grandee, Alonso Perez de Guzman, Duke of Medina
Sidonia, was appointed nominal General. The fleet
was slowly patched into an appearance of efficiency,
but it could not sail until the middle of May, 1588.
To strengthen it nearly all the galleons of the
Indian Guard were added to it, leaving the Atlantic
trade route almost unprotected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in England, on December 21, 1587,
Lord Howard of Effingham, Lord High Admiral,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>had received his commission as Commander-in-Chief
at sea. His official rank was rather civil
than naval, and he was placed in chief command
for much the same reason as Medina Sidonia had
been. He was, however, greatly superior to the
Spaniard in moral qualities, and, though somewhat
lacking in firmness of character, was always ready
to yield to the advice of the experienced seamen
with whom the navy swarmed. Drake, the guiding
spirit of the resistance, was given the command of
an independent squadron at Plymouth. When the
news of Santa Cruz’s death came in February, there
appeared to be some chance of peace, and commissioners
from the contending Powers met at
Flushing. Howard’s fleet was partly demobilized,
but he himself, with a picked force, was ordered to
make a demonstration off Flushing. In March,
however, news came that the Armada would sail on
the 20th, and the whole Navy was mobilized.</p>

<p>Drake himself was full of contempt for the Spanish
sea-power, and endeavoured to induce the Government
to allow him to attack the Armada in port.
After repeated representations, he triumphed. Lord
Howard was ordered to leave a force to watch Parma,
who was making a precedent for Napoleon in 1804,
by building a flotilla for the transport of his army,
and to join Drake with the bulk of his fleet. This
practically amounted to giving Drake the command
of the English Navy. With Howard present he
was nominally only second, but there is ample
evidence that he was the real chief. Abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Howard’s name was hardly mentioned. Drake was
recognized as the English leader by everybody, from
the Pope downwards.</p>

<p>Howard was much addicted to nepotism. To
command the Channel Squadron he appointed his
nephew, Lord Henry Seymour, to guide whose inexperience
two veteran admirals, Sir Henry Palmer
and Sir William Wynter, had to be left behind.
Seymour had under his command three of the
finest galleons of the Royal Navy, five smaller
ones, several pinnaces, and the whole of the ships
supplied by the East Coast and Cinque Ports. As
Parma’s flotilla was already closely blockaded by
Dutch ships, this large force was practically wasted.
Howard took off to the West eleven splendid
galleons and eight pinnaces of the Royal Navy, with
some forty private ships and pinnaces, half of them
furnished by London. Drake at Plymouth had five
galleons specially chosen by himself for their sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
qualities, twenty of the finest private ships in the
country, and a number of pinnaces.</p>

<p>The English Navy ships were very heavily
armed, largely owing to the influence of Drake.
Some were, indeed, so over-gunned that they could
not use their lower tiers in a swell, and there was a
lack of trained gunners. The Government also,
unused to warfare on a great scale, failed to send
supplies and ammunition in sufficient quantity.</p>

<p>On May 23 Howard and Drake effected a
junction off Plymouth, and now had a united fleet
of about 100 sail, manned by 10,000 men. At once
Drake began to urge the necessity of sailing to
attack the Armada in port. On May 30 the whole
fleet put out, but encountered gales, and was obliged
to return on June 6. Meanwhile, on May 18, the
Spanish fleet had sailed from Lisbon, but by June 9
had to put into Coruña with half its stores spoilt, short
of water, crews down in hundreds with sickness,
and with a third of its numbers missing. Medina
Sidonia and his staff, except Don Pedro de Valdes,
Admiral of the Andalucian Squadron, considered
that to continue the attempt was hopeless. Philip
refused to listen to them, and for a month the fleet
lay huddled in Coruña, collecting its stray ships,
painfully refitting, revictualling, and recruiting its
crews with raw peasants from Galicia. Some of
the store-ships had drifted almost to the English
coast, perilously near Howard’s clutches, before they
were recalled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Plymouth Drake and Howard were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
also struggling with difficulties, the chief of which
was shortage of supplies. The unlettered genius
at the head of the fleet never ceased to endeavour
to impress upon his Admiral his aggressive tactics.
After much argument the whole fleet took up the
station off Ushant, which was afterwards to be so
famous; and on July 7 the wind blew fair for Spain.
Drake insisted on a Council being called, and set
forth his arguments more urgently than ever. After
a long debate the sea-admirals prevailed over the
hesitation of the half-feudal entourage of Howard,
and at eight o’clock in the evening the English Navy
made sail for Spain. Had Drake never done anything
else, this splendid dash would stamp him for
all time as a captain of the first order. What would
have happened to the Armada had Drake attacked
it in Coruña is not doubtful. But almost within sight
of the Spanish coast the breeze died away, and then
turned against the English. They were forced to
put about, and on the 12th were back at Plymouth.
There they lay for a week, straining every nerve
to revictual, dismissing some of the ships so as to
fully man others whose crews were weakened by
disease. On the afternoon of the 20th the officers,
after a hard day’s work, were on the Hoe of
Plymouth, some of them amusing themselves with
a game of bowls, when Captain Fleming burst upon
them with the news that the Armada was off the
Lizard!</p>

<p>It was a staggering blow. The English were
caught in the same predicament as the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
would have been a week before. Everybody turned
to the short, sturdy, thick-set ‘pirate’ captain upon
whom England pinned her faith, and Drake replied
by one of those little bits of posing by which great
captains so often encourage their followers. ‘Plenty
of time&mdash;plenty of time!’ he remarked with studied
coolness. ‘We’ll finish the game, and then go and
finish the Spaniards!’&mdash;or words to that effect. It
may be imagined that the great seaman’s nonchalance
had an excellent effect in steadying the nerves of
his excited and less tried colleagues.</p>

<p>None the less, the situation was critical. The
Spaniards were a few miles to the windward of
Plymouth. There was but one remedy&mdash;to put
to sea at once in the teeth of the wind. It says
volumes for the efficiency of the captains and crews
that it was successfully done. Everyone worked
to such excellent purpose that by next morning
54 ships, under Drake and Howard, were clear of
the Sound and beating out to sea, while Hawkins,
the Rear-Admiral, was warping out the remaining
10. Besides these 64 ships, there were some
20 light craft. Other vessels were in harbour, but
not immediately available owing to lack of hands.
The 64 ships included 16 Royal Navy galleons of
from 250 to 1,000 tons, 5 private galleons from 300
to 400 tons, and 43 between 140 and 200 tons.</p>

<p>Turning to the Spaniards, the original organization
of their fleet had been in six ship squadrons,
one galleasse (giant galley) squadron, one galley
squadron, one light squadron, and one <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">urca</i> (cargo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
vessel) squadron, the last being mainly intended for
store-carrying, though its vessels were armed. The
six ship squadrons included two of war galleons and
four of armed merchantmen and private ships. Each
consisted nominally of ten ships, except the Castillian
squadron, which contained four armed merchantmen
besides its ten galleons.</p>

<p>Between May and July ships lost company and
did not all rejoin, while to replace them others were
added. So far as can be ascertained, the Spanish
fleet, when it arrived off the Lizard, included
19 galleons, 4 galleasses, 41 armed merchantmen,
27 <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">urcas</i>, 16 water and salvage vessels, and about
40 small craft. The real commander, who was to
Medina Sidonia what Drake was to Howard, was
Don Diego Flores de Valdes, Admiral of the
Castillian galleons. The better to discharge his
duties, he sailed with the Duke on the flagship <i class="shipname">San
Martin</i>. It is characteristic of Philip that he had
chosen for the substantial command a man inferior
in every respect to some of the other admirals.
The squadrons and commanders were as follows:<a name="FNanchor_K" id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a></p>

<p>Pedro de Valdes told Drake that the total force
included 110 armed vessels and 32 non-effective
craft. There were between 7,000 and 8,000 seamen
and perhaps 17,000 soldiers, besides gentlemen
and slaves; but the seamen were of many
races and some raw recruits. Many of the soldiers
were also raw, though there were five Tercios, or
brigades, of veterans on board.</p>

<p class="subcap">Length, 7 feet 11 inches; calibre, 3·92 inches; weight of shot, 5 lbs. Guns of this
class formed the main armament of the bulk of the English merchant-ships.</p></div></div>

<p>The Spanish ships were of more antiquated
pattern than those of the English, and looked to
amateur observers very large and formidable. As
a fact, the Spanish galleons were no larger, ship for
ship, than those of their adversaries, and were
much more lightly armed. All the armed merchantmen
were of over 300 tons, but they carried no
armament of guns in proportion to their size.
Some of the Italian ships were wretchedly armed.
Still, it is possible to labour this point too much.
The English galleons were undoubtedly by far the
best fighting ships in the two fleets, and the fine
London trading galleons were also formidably
armed; but so far as can be seen, the bulk of the
English private craft were armed mainly with 4 and
5 pounders. The inferiority of the Spaniards chiefly
lay in the fact that they were even weaker in
gunners than the English, as well as badly supplied
with ammunition. The military officers who commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
most of the ships were too ignorant and
too self-satisfied to trouble about the guns, relying
instead upon their soldiers. The result was that
no effective reply could be made to the often
ill-directed but rapid English fire, while the
soldiers crowded in the ships were slaughtered
helplessly.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>ORDER OF SAILING OF THE SPANISH ARMADA.</p>

<p class="hang">Constructed from Spanish documentary material. The English idea of a crescent
formation was due to their attacking the rear squadron which sailed in line
abreast. If the ships at the extremities did not keep station well the crescent
form would no doubt have appeared.</p></div></div>

<p>Philip’s strategic orders were faulty. No actual
point of junction with Parma was named. The
fleet was to go to the Downs, avoiding an action if
possible until the two forces had united&mdash;a difficult
and indeed impossible task. The division of the
English fleet was known or anticipated, but not
Howard’s junction with Drake. On the basis
that Howard with the Royal Navy was in the
Downs, and Drake with a fleet chiefly of privateers
in the west, the Armada was tactically organized
in three main divisions. At its head sailed the
vessels of Portugal and Castille in one squadron
under Medina Sidonia and Diego de Valdes. The
position of the galleasses is a little uncertain. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
has been thought that they sailed separately with
the chief flagships; but they are generally found
acting together. Behind this vanguard was the
Light Division, and behind it again the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">urcas</i>.
Behind the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">urcas</i> was the rearguard in two divisions:
the ‘Rearguard,’ or left wing, consisting of
Recalde’s and Pedro de Valdes’ squadrons, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the chief command of the former; the Vanguard, or
right wing, comprising the squadrons of Oquendo
and Bertendona, under Leyva. Sidonia and
Diego de Valdes flew their flags together on the
Portuguese galleon <i class="shipname">San Martin</i>. Recalde was on
the Portuguese galleon <i class="shipname">San Juan</i>, and Leyva
on an Italian ship, the <i class="shipname">Rata Encoronada</i>. The
ships generally were badly found. The tactical
formation by line abreast, too, was faulty, since the
broadsides were masked&mdash;a proof of how little the
Spanish officers realized that their best weapon
was the gun. But the squadronal organization was
excellent for manœuvring, and discipline was good.</p>

<p>The ships seen by Fleming were not the whole
Armada, but Pedro de Valdes with his squadron,
and about twenty other ships. The rest of the fleet
had been scattered in a gale, but on the 20th it
reunited and proceeded up the Cornish coast towards
Plymouth. Along the shore the Spaniards could
see the beacons signalling their approach. The
Pope’s consecrated banner was hoisted on the <i class="shipname">San
Martin</i> and everyone knelt at the signal to pray for
victory.</p>

<p>The experienced Spanish admirals, no less than
the impetuous Lieutenant-General de Leyva, urged
their commander-in-chief to push into Plymouth and
destroy the English fleet at its anchorage; but
while they deliberated ships were made out ahead.
It became obvious to the astonished Spaniards that
the English had slipped out of the trap. Presently
a scouting pinnace arrived confirming the unwelcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
impression, and also bringing tidings that the ships
were the united fleets of Howard and Drake.
Sidonia, at a complete loss, anchored his fleet to
wait for daybreak.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Drake and Howard had reached out
to the Eddystone, and at dawn on the 21st they
bore boldly down to attack the Armada, which was
formed in the squadronal order of battle already
described. The English fleet, coming from seaward
in a long line ahead, passed Leyva’s division, and
developed a fierce attack upon Recalde. The
Vizcayan squadron was panic-stricken, Recalde’s
flagship completely disabled, and not for two hours
did Sidonia and Leyva succeed in supporting him.
Howard, thereupon, drew off. As the fleets lay
watching each other, however, the Guipuzcoan <i class="shipname">San
Salvador</i> was disabled by an explosion. Howard
again threatened an attack. Pedro de Valdes’
flagship, the <i class="shipname">Nuestra Senora del Rosario</i>, was also
disabled by a collision as she put about, but the
Spanish squadrons came up to the rescue in such
admirable order that Howard again drew off. The
injured Spanish ships were taken in tow, and the
Armada made sail to continue its voyage, as an
attack on Plymouth was obviously now out of the
question.</p>

<p>The English pursued. The leading of the van
was given to Drake, who flew his flag on the far-famed
<i class="shipname">Revenge</i>, the smartest ship and fastest sailer
in the English navy. His attention was, however,
distracted in the night by some strange lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
with a somewhat imperfect appreciation of his duty,
for which he was afterwards unduly blamed, he
turned aside to examine them. They proved to be
harmless merchantmen, and Drake put about to
resume his post, but on his way he fell in with the
crippled <i class="shipname">Nuestra Senora del Rosario</i>, which had
fallen behind the Spanish fleet. Resistance being
clearly useless&mdash;since he was alone amid the English
fleet&mdash;Valdes surrendered. The <i class="shipname">San Salvador</i> also
was so damaged that the Spaniards abandoned her,
and she was taken by Howard, who was close
behind.</p>

<p>This was a bad beginning for the Spaniards.
While Recalde repaired his damaged ship, Leyva
took chief command of the rear, which was
strengthened by three galleasses, three Portuguese
galleons, and the Italian galleon <i class="shipname">San Francesco de
Florencia</i> from the van. On the night of the 22nd
the fleets were becalmed off Portland. A group of
English ships drifted apart from their main body,
and in the bright moonlight the oared galleasses
might have attacked them; but Captain-General
Monçada was sulking over a fancied slight, and
would not move. At dawn a north-west breeze
sprang up, and the Spaniards boldly bore down to
the attack.</p>

<p>A tumultuous engagement followed, in which
want of organization in the English fleet prevented
it from gaining any real advantage. Drake succeeded
in weathering the Spanish seaward wing;
but on the other flank, Frobisher, the famous explorer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
who commanded the <i class="shipname">Triumph</i>, the largest
galleon in either fleet, was cut off and fiercely
attacked, and Howard and Drake had to come back
to the rescue. Sidonia’s flagship was badly mauled
by Howard’s flagship, the <i class="shipname">Ark</i>, and no doubt the
Spaniards suffered more than their adversaries; but
on the whole the battle was drawn.</p>

<p>The English had learnt a lesson, and next day,
as they awaited fresh supplies of ammunition, the
fleet was organized into four squadrons, commanded
respectively by Howard, Drake, Hawkins, and
Frobisher. The latter owed his command to the
courage which he had shown at Portland; but he
was no tactician, and attributed Drake’s scientific
manœuvres to cowardice.</p>

<p>The Spanish admirals knew well the weak point
of Philips design. Recalde had served under
Menendez, and was especially urgent in pointing
out that an English port must be seized as a base.
It was eventually decided to occupy the Isle of
Wight, and establish themselves there till a plan
of concerted action could be managed with Parma.
The English harassed the rearguard incessantly, and
eventually it had to sail constantly in order of battle.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th the fleets lay becalmed
to the south of the Isle of Wight. The
Portuguese galleon <i class="shipname">San Luis</i> had fallen behind the
Armada, and Hawkins attacked her by towing up
with his boats. The gallant Leyva came back to
the rescue with three galleasses and some ships,
whereupon Howard towed up to assist Hawkins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
After a sharp encounter, Leyva rescued the <i class="shipname">San
Luis</i>, but the galleasses were very roughly handled.</p>

<p>A breeze now sprang up, and the English attacked.
Frobisher, with bulldog courage, went at Recalde,
and was again cut off. The Spaniards appeared to
have the <i class="shipname">Triumph</i> at their mercy, but her boats
were lowered and took her in tow. The wind rose
again; her sails filled, and she slipped away, leaving
the pursuing Spaniards just as if they had been at
anchor. So says Calderon, the Spanish Fleet
Treasurer.</p>

<p>Howard apparently took little further part in the
action, except to assist Frobisher and contain part
of the Spanish fleet. But under cover of the banks
of gun-fire smoke Drake and Hawkins carried out
successfully a finely conceived and decisive stroke
of tactics. Working well out to sea, they bore down
irresistibly upon the Armada’s weather wing, with
the object of driving it upon the ‘Owers,’ the
dangerous shoals which had had their place in Lord
Lisle’s plan of action against D’Annibault in 1545.
The weather ships were forced helplessly to leeward.
The attack on Frobisher and Howard died away,
because Sidonia had to support Leyva’s broken
division; and to save themselves from being driven
upon the Owers, the Spaniards were forced to retreat
eastward. The triumph of the English tactics was
complete. The Spaniards were prevented from
occupying the island, and in despair sailed for Calais.
They were badly demoralized by the English
fighting and manœuvring powers, and their losses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
had been heavy. Messages were sent on to Parma
for ammunition and some vessels that might outsail
the fast English ships. Meanwhile Howard could
not find room for the soldiers who were streaming
out from the coast to reinforce his crews.</p>

<p>Among the noble volunteers who hurried to join
him were the Earl of Cumberland, soon to be a
famous admiral, and Robert Carey (son of Lord
Hunsdon), to whose Memoirs we owe an invaluable
picture of Elizabethan times. Carey tells the story
of their adventure. They ‘took post-horse and
rode straight to Portsmouth, where we found a
frigate that carried us to sea; and having sought for
the fleets a whole day, the night after we fell in
among them: where it was our fortune to light first
on the Spanish fleet; and finding ourselves in the
wrong, we tacked about, and in short time got to
our own fleet.’ Evidently they had a narrow escape.
They found Howard so well attended that he had
no cabins to spare, and so boarded the <i class="shipname">Bonaventure</i>,
in which they took part in the Battle of Gravelines.</p>

<p>On the day after the battle Howard celebrated
the victory by knighting some of his commanders,
including Hawkins and Frobisher. All through the
26th and 27th the pursuit went on, until about
four o’clock in the afternoon Sidonia anchored off
Calais. Nothing had been heard from Parma, and
the pilots said that they could answer for the safety
of the fleet no farther, as they did not know the
North Sea. The English anchored also, to windward
of the Armada, and less than a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Meanwhile a pinnace had been sent to call in
the Channel Squadron from the Downs. Seymour
and Wynter had already made up their minds to
join Howard wherever he might be, and wasted not
a moment. They had only three days’ provisions
in hand, but none the less weighed and beat across
to Calais. The disheartened Spaniards made no
attempt to prevent the junction, and at nightfall
the whole available naval forces of England were
gathered within striking distance of the foe.</p>

<p class="subcap">The first of the great English oceanic Admirals.</p>

<p class="subcap"><i>From an engraving by Elstracke.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On Sunday morning a council of war assembled
on the <i class="shipname">Ark</i>, and it was decided to attempt to dislodge
the Armada from its anchorage by drifting
fireships among its crowded ranks. Combustibles
had already been collected at Dover, but lest valuable
time should be lost it was decided to use vessels
from the fleet. Drake and Hawkins immediately
offered two of their own ships for the service.
Eight in all were collected and hurriedly prepared.
Guns and stores were left on board, for there was
no time to remove them. Captains Yonge and
Prouse were entrusted with the dangerous duty of
directing them, and some time after midnight they
were fired and bore down with wind and tide upon
the horror-stricken Spaniards. Everyone thought
of what Gianibelli’s fireships had done at Antwerp
only a few years before. Sidonia, seeing no help
for it, ordered or permitted cables to be cut, and
there was a nerve-breaking scene of disorder and
panic. Ship collided with ship in the darkness,
and there were many accidents. Monçada’s flagship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the <i class="shipname">San Lorenzo</i>, lost her rudder; the <i class="shipname">San
Martin</i> herself was almost overtaken by a fireship
before she could work clear. Still, the material
damage was small. Wind and tide carried the
fleet clear, and the fireships burnt out harmlessly.
Sidonia, with the <i class="shipname">San Marcos</i>, the <i class="shipname">San Juan</i>, and
one or two other ships, anchored as soon as they
were clear, but the bulk of the fleet drifted away
in a straggling line off Gravelines. The wind was
about south-west, so that they could not easily close
up on Sidonia. The latter therefore weighed to
rejoin them.</p>

<p>At dawn the English admirals saw their foes
scattered, but also perceived that Sidonia was endeavouring
to reunite his fleet. At once they got
under weigh and made sail, Drake leading the
attack on the right, Hawkins to his left rear, then
Howard, and then Frobisher, with Wynter and
Seymour still farther back. All the accounts seem
to show that the squadrons did not succeed in
engaging simultaneously. The Channel Squadron
came into action at least two hours after Drake.</p>

<p>It was now that the inexperienced Lord High
Admiral committed a huge blunder. The <i class="shipname">San
Lorenzo</i> was seen on the right trying to get into
Calais, and with a total lack of appreciation of his
duties as Commander-in-Chief he turned off to seize
her, followed by nearly all his squadron. He took
and plundered the galleasse, and Monçada was killed;
but for nearly four hours a fifth of the English
fleet was absent from the critical point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Sidonia’s pilots were anxious. They assured him
that if the fleet continued to run before the wind it
must go ashore. It was a crushing announcement,
but Sidonia, to his credit be it said, did not flinch.
Courage Spaniards have never lacked. Pinnaces
were sent to warn the fleet, and the devoted flagship
and her consorts swung round to face the
enemy. In front, and nearest to Sidonia, the ever
famous <i class="shipname">Revenge</i>, flying Drake’s flag, was bearing
down upon him, closely followed by three galleons
of the Royal Navy, and for miles behind them the
great English fleet was setting all sail and streaming
to the attack. No time was to be lost. The Spanish
captains knew the peril, and were coming back to
the rescue of the Admiral. The English came on
in stern silence, reserving their fire until the last
moment, in order not to waste their already too
scanty supply of ammunition. At sunrise Drake
was within easy range of Sidonia’s little group.
The <i class="shipname">Revenge</i> fired her bow battery into the <i class="shipname">San
Martin</i>, and then, hauling to the wind, sailed past
her larboard broadside, letting fly with every gun
that she could bring to bear. Behind her came the
<i class="shipname">Nonpareil</i> (Vice-Admiral Thomas Fenner) and so,
one after another, all Drake’s squadron filed past,
cannonading furiously and holding on after their
leader to beat off the main body of the Armada,
which was standing out to the rescue of the
admiral. Hawkins next came into action and
fastened on Sidonia, but he does not seem to have
supported Drake; and the result was that one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
one about fifty of the best Spanish ships came into
action about their Admiral. Frobisher apparently
was in action soon after Hawkins, but the Channel
Squadron did not come up till about 9 a.m.; and
Howard, having wasted so much time, was not
on the scene until past ten. The Spaniards were
never really able to form proper order, and as they
struggled singly into action they were attacked by
whole English squadrons and fearfully mangled.
Recalde’s division mostly found its way to Sidonia’s
right, or weather wing, and upon it the English
concentrated their fiercest efforts. The English
cannonade was overwhelming. The crowded Spanish
ships were mere slaughter-pens. Deserters declared
that some of them were full of blood, but surrender
was never heard of. They fought to the bitter end.
The finest fighting was done by the Portuguese
galleon <i class="shipname">San Mateo</i>. She was full of veterans
from the Tercio de Sicilia, and had on board
its Colonel, Don Diego de Pimentel. She was
surrounded by the whole Channel Squadron, and
fought on, answering the storm of cannon-balls
with musketry, until Recalde rescued her. An
English officer, filled with admiration, hailed her to
surrender; but the desperate veterans shot him, and
cursed the English cowards who would not close
and fight like men. The <i class="shipname">San Felipe</i>, under Don
Francisco Alvarez de Toledo, a kinsman of the
terrible Alva, vied with the <i class="shipname">San Mateo</i> in the
heroism of her resistance. In one of the shifts of
the battle the <i class="shipname">San Martin</i> was out of action. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
might have escaped, but Sidonia bravely went into
the conflict again.</p>

<p>The English had to endure no such ordeal, but
they fought with furious determination. The <i class="shipname">Revenge</i>
was severely battered. Wynter’s <i class="shipname">Vanguard</i> fired
500 30-, 18-, and 9-pounder shot&mdash;a remarkable
achievement in those days. But so completely had
the English the advantage that, according to Vice-Admiral
Fenner, they lost only sixty killed.</p>

<p>By three o’clock the battle was at an end. Nearly
twenty Spanish ships were cut off (among them
the <i class="shipname">San Martin</i>, <i class="shipname">San Mateo</i>, and <i class="shipname">San Felipe</i>),
all sadly shattered, full of dead and dying, and
with not a shot left to reply to the merciless cannonade
that was still pouring upon them. Nothing,
it seemed, could save them, when suddenly a squall
descended upon the struggling fleets. The English
were forced to cease fighting to meet the danger.
The crippled Spaniards, unable to manœuvre, had
to put before the wind, and the combatants were
parted. The Spaniards had no power left to fight.
All that night they fled blindly, followed by the
English, while their shattered ships went down and
drifted ashore. Several were lost in this way, including
the <i class="shipname">San Felipe</i> and the <i class="shipname">San Mateo</i>, and
with the wind as it was nothing could save them
from all going ashore.</p>

<p>Sidonia, having confessed and prepared for death,
turned to bay; but there was no heart left in the
fleet to follow their Admiral’s example, though
Leyva and Oquendo, brave to the last, at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
supported him. The English fleet was holding off
to let the Zeeland sandbanks do their deadly work,
and Leyva and Oquendo urged Sidonia to at least
make a show of attacking. It could not be.
Discipline was gone. They cursed him in their
despair, and shouted to the crew to throw Diego
Valdes overboard! Nearer and nearer to the
banks drifted the miserable throng of shattered,
blood-stained hulks that now represented the
Fortunate and Invincible Armada, when suddenly
the wind shifted. The English could not understand
it. Twice God had intervened to save the
foe! The Armada was able to bear out from the
shoals and steer a course to the northward in deep
water.</p>

<p>So ended the great struggle. On the surface the
Armada had suffered little; its numbers were not
greatly diminished. But in fact nearly all its fighting
ships were so mangled that they could hardly
hope to survive a severe gale. They were mere
floating dens of misery, full of men wounded, sick, and
worn out. The loss of life at Gravelines can only be
conjectured. The Spaniards admitted 1,400 killed
and wounded. But it is known that the <i class="shipname">San Mateo</i>
and the <i class="shipname">San Felipe</i> lost nearly all their companies, and
the <i class="shipname">Maria Juan</i> of Biscay over two-thirds of hers.
Judging from such evidence as this, the total can
hardly be estimated at less than 4,000.</p>

<p>Seymour, to his disgust, was left to watch Parma,
while the English main fleet pursued the Armada
until it was certain that it did not intend to put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
the Forth. There was apparently some thought of
fighting again. Howard’s squadron still had a fair
supply of ammunition on board, but the others had
expended nearly all theirs; and on August 2 Drake
flew a flag of council to discuss the matter. ‘It
was found,’ says Carey, ‘that in the whole fleet
there was not munition sufficient to make half a
fight.’ Compelled to be content, the fleet ran for
home. It was time, for already disease was beginning
to rage in the insanitary ships, and many men
died before the fleet could be paid off.</p>

<p>The story of how the beaten Armada made its
retreat round Scotland and Ireland is better known
than that of its engagements with the English
fleet. There was little water, and rations were
reduced to starvation limit. The shattered vessels
could not fight the Atlantic gales, and sank
in the raging seas, or went ashore on the iron-bound
shores of the Hebrides and Ireland. Such
of the crews as succeeded in landing were massacred
either by Irish kernes or English soldiers.
Leyva perished near Dunluce. Some sixty ships
only struggled through to the Biscayan ports. In
some there was no water for fourteen days, and the
wine was nearly out. The half-dead crews were
often unable to work the ships, and they drifted
helplessly into such harbours as lay in their aimless
course. Recalde and Oquendo came home only to
die exhausted and broken-hearted, and the roll of
death was swelled by thousands who had survived
England’s artillery and the Atlantic storms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
The popular impression of the catastrophe of the
Armada still is that it was beaten by the English
privateers. The Admirals did not think so. The
pamphlet printed for general circulation, probably
inspired by Drake, states that the work was done
by the Royal Navy and a few merchants. Wynter
said bluntly that the private ships were of hardly
any use at all, and so another cherished idea fades
into the limbo of ancient misconceptions. The real
truth is set forth by the Italian writer Ubaldino,
who points out that the English won because they
had a properly organized Royal Navy, composed of
excellent sailing ships, well armed with artillery, not
cumbered with useless soldiers, and directed not by
mediævally-minded soldiers, but by scientific seamen.
In his summing-up lies a lesson to be
remembered by Englishmen for all time.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE AFTERMATH OF THE ARMADA</span></h2>

<p>The defeat of the Armada of 1588 is commonly
regarded as the end of any danger to England from
Spain. This, however, is far from the truth. Had
Elizabeth and her minister Burghley been less timid,
it might have been. But they would not allow a
great counter-attack on Spain to be delivered by
the whole strength of England; and the semi-private
expedition of Drake and Sir John Norreys in
1589, though gallantly made, was hampered by injudicious
instructions, and eventually failed. Worse
still, Drake lost Elizabeth’s confidence, and retired
into private life. The English relapsed into mere
aimless, commerce-destroying attempts, which had
very little real success.</p>

<p>Philip, with a heroism which compels admiration,
despite the misery which it entailed upon his people,
set to work immediately after 1588 to build up a
properly organized navy. His dogged determination
never wavered. In his efforts he was splendidly
assisted by Pero Menendez Marquez, son of
Menendez de Aviles, who invented a new type of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
swift warship for treasure-carrying service. Spain
lacked good timber, and the supplies of it, brought
from the Baltic, were often intercepted by English
cruisers. Seamen also were lacking, and the old faulty
threefold division of the crews was adhered to. Yet,
in 1591, Don Alonso de Bazan, brother of Santa Cruz,
was able to appear at the Azores with a fleet of
sixty-three sail, and to drive away Lord Thomas
Howard’s squadron, with the loss of the far-famed
<i class="shipname">Revenge</i>, the story of whose wonderful fight is enshrined
in English poetry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in France the Huguenot Henry of
Navarre had become king. He was opposed by
the Catholic League, which was energetically
supported by Philip. Elizabeth sent troops to the
support of Henry; but the Spaniards were able to
seize ports in Brittany, and there establish a base of
operations dangerously close to England, occupied
not only by a strong force of troops, but by a
squadron of galleys, available for brief raids in fine
weather. The reports of the progress of the new
Spanish Navy were more and more alarming. The
English squadrons were kept off the trade routes by
powerful Spanish fleets, and year after year the
American bullion came safely home.</p>

<p>Elizabeth now did what she should have done
before, and summoned Drake from Devon to take
a fleet to America. The object was to attack
Panama, and intercept Philip’s treasure trains.
But she made the mistake of associating with him
his kinsman Hawkins, broken by age and ill-health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
This was in the summer of 1595, and while Drake
was organizing his squadron at Plymouth, four of
the galleys in Brittany sailed, about July 15, from
the Blavet River on a raid against the Channel
Islands. They raided Penmarch, but found the
wind foul for the Islands, and decided to make a
descent on the Scillies instead. The galley was
always useless for a voyage of any length, being
unable to carry supplies sufficient for its crew of
some 400 soldiers, slaves, and seamen. Water ran
out, and the galleys put into Mount’s Bay. On the
23rd they were before Mousehole. Six hundred
soldiers were landed, and finding nothing to oppose
them, they devastated the neighbourhood, burned
Mousehole, Newlyn, St. Paul, and the adjoining
hamlets, and marched on Penzance. Sir Francis
Godolphin hurriedly collected 200 peasants for its
defence, but they dared not face the Spanish veterans,
and dispersed. The Spaniards burned Penzance,
and next day held a church parade on Western
Hill, and vowed to found a monastery there when
England was conquered. They might have done
more mischief, but when they heard that the terrible
Drake was at Plymouth, they withdrew forthwith.
This petty operation, after years of patient toil, and
though the war was to last for eight years longer,
was the only Spanish landing on English soil.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s last West Indian expedition was a
melancholy failure. Hawkins died on the way out.
The ports were now found fortified and garrisoned;
Drake failed before Puerto Rico, and on January 27,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
1596, the great seaman, baffled and broken-hearted,
died of dysentery off Puerto Bello, and was laid to
rest in the waters whereon so many of his boldest
deeds had been wrought.</p>

<p>His death was a national misfortune. In 1596
the Spaniards took Calais, and thus gained an outpost
only twenty miles from England. Elizabeth
retorted by a great expedition under the young Earl
of Essex and Howard of Effingham. Cadiz was
taken and destroyed, with twelve warships and a
merchant fleet worth 8,000,000 ducats. The blow
to Spanish industry was crushing, but, despite Essex’s
entreaty, Howard would not garrison the impregnable
port. Had he done so, it might well have
become to England what Gibraltar is now. As it
was, Philip was goaded into a fresh attempt at invasion;
but the ill-equipped fleet, largely composed
of embargoed foreign craft filled with soldiers, which
he hounded to sea in October, under the Conde de
Santa Gadea, was so shattered by a storm, that
little of it could ever be rallied again.</p>

<p>Philip was now bankrupt, but at the cost of
misery, which left its mark on Spain for centuries,
he prepared for yet one attempt more. In 1597
Essex sailed with a large fleet to the Azores on a
nearly fruitless cruise against the Spanish treasure
fleet. By amazing exertions a new Spanish fleet
had been assembled in Ferrol, and while Essex
was on his way home the last great Armada,
136 ships strong, reached the coast of Brittany.
Another fleet was following from Lisbon, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
all there were some 18,000 troops on board. The
plan of action was that which Menendez had laid
down twenty years before. Essex, however, safely
made Plymouth in a violent gale, which scattered
the ill-found Spanish fleet, this time, happily, with
little loss of life. It was Philip’s last effort, and a
year later he died.</p>

<p>After his death the war languished until 1601.
The English Navy was only employed on abortive
commerce-destroying expeditions, and was looked
upon with contempt by the bold privateers who
harried the Spanish Main. In 1602 Spain made a
last effort, and, assisted by the slackness and want
of foresight of Elizabeth’s chief minister, Sir Robert
Cecil, son of Burghley, succeeded in landing 4,000
troops in Ireland. This woke up the drowsy government.
The Spaniards were blockaded in Kinsale
by the army of Lord Deputy Mountjoy and the
fleet under Sir Richard Leveson. A reinforcing
squadron was annihilated in Castlehaven, and Kinsale
forced to surrender. In 1602 Leveson sailed
to the Spanish coast and won a victory at Cezimbra,
but in 1603 Elizabeth died. Her successor, James I.,
was only too ready to come to terms, and made
peace forthwith, without settling the Indies trade
question, over which so much blood was subsequently
shed. It was the first ill-service done by the Stuarts
to the country over which they had come to rule,
and it was not to be the last.</p>

<p>The lessons to be drawn from the story of the
first Anglo-Spanish War appear to be three:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
1. So long as an island state hold the command
of the sea, and it be exercised with reasonable
skill and prudence, that state is practically invulnerable.
Excepting Drake, no Englishman of
the sixteenth century apparently understood how
to utilize England’s naval supremacy, hence the
frequent approach to success of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>2. In a naval war the operations must be
vigorous and drastic, and not wasted upon mere
commerce destroying. All England’s privateers and
cruisers failed to take a single Spanish treasure fleet.</p>

<p>3. It is necessary to have (<i>a</i>) a regular military
force strong enough to assist the fleet in its operations
on an enemy’s coast; (<i>b</i>) an organized defensive
force to deal with isolated raids.</p>

<span class="subhead">DE RUIJTER AND WILLIAM OF ORANGE</span></h2>

<p>When the danger from Spain had passed away,
it was not long before England and the Dutch
Republic began to take up a position of rivalry.
The two States had fought side by side against
Spain, but they had had trade differences, which
culminated in an abominable massacre by the Dutch
East India Company of English merchants at
Amboyna, in the Moluccas. This was in 1623, and
the Governments of James I. and Charles I. had
failed to obtain any success by diplomatic means.
The Dutch were supreme in the world of sea
commerce, and trade rivalry and political differences
brought on the first Dutch War in 1652-53. The
result was the victory of England, but it was by no
means decisive or final, and twelve years later the
two countries were again at war.</p>

<p>In the second Dutch War, twelve years later,
there is little of which England can be proud.
The Restoration Government’s corruption and mismanagement
had allowed the Navy to fall far below
the high level of efficiency to which it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
raised by Oliver Cromwell. The ships were crowded
with useless fine gentlemen from the Court. The
seamen were so ill-provided that they deserted in
numbers to escape the misery of life on shipboard.
Scotland had no interest in England’s wars, and
many Scottish seamen preferred to serve under the
Dutch flag rather than that of Great Britain. The
result was several very bloody and indecisive battles,
in which the Dutch, upon the whole, held their own.
Finding that little advantage had been gained,
Charles II. was ready to come again to terms, and
in May, 1667, Peace Commissioners met at Breda.
In truth, there was hardly any other alternative.
The Great Plague and the Great Fire of London
had been stunning blows to the prosperity of England.
Meanwhile, though Peace Commissioners were
sitting, there was no armistice. Yet no attempt was
made by the English Government to fit out for sea the
Navy, which was lying dismantled in harbour after
the late campaign. Only two commerce-destroying
squadrons were sent out. At the same time measures
were taken to fortify the coasts. In other words,
the peace conference was considered as a sufficient
protection, and the fleet was deliberately demobilized.
Ineptitude could go no further. The Duke of York
(afterwards James II.), as High Admiral, approved&mdash;a
fact which gives the measure of his essentially
dull and stupid character. No one appears to have
anticipated danger. The work of fortification
went forward slowly or not at all. The Court was
in the midst of its usual profligacies when, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
June 7, the Dutch fleet was sighted off the North
Foreland.</p>

<p>While Charles was lounging among his courtiers
at Whitehall, the Dutch, under the direction of the
famous Grand Pensionary de Witt, were preparing
to strike a blow. Late in May a squadron, under
Admiral van Ghent, was despatched, presumably
to distract English attention, to the Forth. Van
Ghent failed to land anywhere, but he made havoc
of the Scots’ coasting trade, and then quietly withdrew
to join the main fleet.</p>

<p>On June 1 seventy men-of-war left the ports of
Holland, and, though scattered by a storm, reassembled
off the North Foreland on the 7th. The
Commander-in-Chief was Admiral Michiel Adriaanszoon
de Ruijter, the hero of the war, and the
greatest of all the great seamen whom his country
has borne. His whole naval career is a splendid
story of calm, dauntless courage, of unerring skill,
of battle after battle gained, or maintained with
honour against desperate odds.</p>

<p>At Whitehall all was confusion and dismay.
Pepys has given a vivid description of the scene.
He himself fully expected to be murdered in a
burst of popular fury. The one man who could be
trusted to do his duty&mdash;Monk, the Lord General&mdash;was
sent to take command at Chatham. Train-bands
and militia were mobilized in frantic haste&mdash;all
too late.</p>

his father’s death he rose against James II. and claimed the crown, but was defeated and
executed.</p></div></div>

<p>On June 9 the advance squadron of the Dutch,
under Admiral van Ghent, was off Gravesend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
chasing merchantmen and naval light craft in panic-terror
up the Thames, while the boom of his guns
could, it is said, be heard in London. There must
have been few who on that day did not look back
with regret to the victorious years of the Commonwealth.
The Dutch fleet, however, carried no
great landing force, and De Ruijter, judging that
London could not be safely attacked, decided to
recall Van Ghent and turn against Chatham, the
headquarters of the English Navy.</p>

<p>Monk reached Rochester on the 11th, but he
could do little. His hard fate was to end his
military career as a helpless spectator of the national
disgrace. The available troops consisted of a weak
Scottish regiment and some seamen at Sheerness,
under Admiral Sir Edward Spragge. The fortifications
were unfinished and unarmed. The ships
were not manned, and, to complete the disgrace,
the seamen refused point-blank to fight for the king
who had starved and robbed them. There is an
even darker side to the gloomy picture. The oncoming
Dutch fleet was full of English and Scottish
seamen, who preferred the good treatment and
regular pay of the States to that of their discredited
king. The dockyard hands&mdash;starving, unpaid, and
mutinous&mdash;deserted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE DUTCH IN THE MEDWAY.</p>

<p class="subcap">(<i>From a Dutch contemporary engraving.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>On June 10 De Ruijter entered the Medway.
Sheerness fort was bombarded into ruins, though
Spragge and his handful of English and Scots
held their ground until an overwhelming force was
landed for the storm. Fifteen guns and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323" class="hidev">323</a></span>
stores at Sheerness were taken, and the Dutch fleet
worked on up the winding reaches of the Medway.
On the 12th the leading squadron under Van
Ghent, with the fireships commanded by Captain
Brackel, arrived at Gillingham Reach, the usual
harbourage of the naval ships. Two small and ill-armed
batteries guarded the entrance. Between
them was stretched a heavy iron chain, and behind
it were anchored three Dutch prizes and some
smaller craft. Higher up Monk was striving
desperately to save the ships. But the dockyard
officials had all fled, and carried with them the
ships’ boats, so that the heavy vessels could not be
towed away. Everywhere there was cowardice,
selfishness, and confusion. Brackel drove straight
for the chain on the flood-tide, and crashed through
it, silencing the impotent forts, and burning all the
ships at the barrier. A little farther up lay the
<i class="shipname">Royal Charles</i>, the finest ship in the British Navy.
She had been the <i class="shipname">Naseby</i> of the Commonwealth,
and had carried Monk himself to victory. She was
almost unarmed, and before Monk could fire her,
the Dutch were at hand. Her crew fled to shore,
and the exultant foe towed her triumphantly down
the river to their fleet.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>A DUTCH TWO-DECKED BATTLESHIP.</p>

<p class="hang b0">With an armament of about 50 guns, the Dutch fleet which inflicted the great humiliation
on England in 1667 was largely composed of ships of this type.</p>

<p class="subcap">(<i>From a contemporary Dutch print.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>The tide was now turning, and Brackel retired
some distance and anchored. Despairing of saving
the <i class="shipname">Royal Oak</i>, <i class="shipname">Great James</i>, and <i class="shipname">Loyal London</i>,
which lay higher up, Monk scuttled them, and sank
three ships in the fairway of the only channel by
which, according to local information, the Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
could approach. On the following day the Dutch
came back with the tide and ran through another
channel pointed out, no doubt, by their English
comrades. Upnor Castle strove in vain to stop
them. They passed its batteries in safety, and
came on to the half-sunken ships which lay aground
in the shallow stream. With hardly any resistance
they fired and destroyed all three. Captain Douglas,
of the <i class="shipname">Royal Oak</i>, died on board his ship, and
his gallant end was the one slight redeeming
feature of the melancholy scene. Had they known
the utter panic and lack of organized defence at
Chatham, the Dutch might well have destroyed the
dockyard. But they did not know; they had inflicted
upon England the greatest humiliation that
she has endured since the day of the Norse rovers,
and so, well content, the small squadron that had
done so much sailed triumphantly down the river,
insulting their humbled enemies with thundering
cheers and songs and victorious music.</p>

<p>For six weeks the victorious Dutch fleet dominated
the English seas. So secure was De Ruijter
that he left only Van Ghent’s squadron to guard
the Thames, and sailed down the Channel as a
conqueror, sweeping up English trade, and terrorizing
the coasts. What he might have done had
his fleet carried troops may be judged from the
pages of Pepys. Panic, confusion, and self-seeking
reigned supreme at Court, and among the seamen
discontent was rife. Sir Edward Spragge did at
last succeed in forming a squadron sufficient to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
the Thames against Van Ghent, but this was all.
When the Peace of Breda was signed in July De
Ruijter still victoriously ranged the English seas.</p>

<p>So ten years after Oliver Cromwell had made
Britain’s name dreaded wherever her flag flew,
Charles II., ‘the Lord’s anointed,’ degraded her to
the dust. He was to wage another war with the
Dutch, and to see the heroic De Ruijter successfully
withstand the combined strength of France
and her jackal&mdash;England. He left his realm the
vassal of France, the national escutcheon bearing a
stain that has never been forgotten, and the once
invincible navy reduced to a mass of rotting hulks
that could not venture out of port.</p>

<p>When James II. succeeded to the throne discontent
was already rife among the people, and when
his natural brother James, Duke of Monmouth,
landed almost alone in Dorsetshire, the West country
peasantry flocked to his standard. The hideous
barbarity with which the premature and ill-conducted
revolt was suppressed merely added fuel to the
smouldering furnace. Had Monmouth been a
stronger man, had he been better supplied with
money, arms, and trained officers, matters might
have been different. The navy could with difficulty
mobilize a small squadron, which was at sea too late
to prevent him from landing.</p>

<p>The fate of the Stuart dynasty was sealed when
James alienated the sympathies of the hitherto
thoroughly servile Anglican Church and the Court,
or ‘Tory’ party, in Parliament. The result was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
temporary, but for the time all-powerful, coalition
against him. A nucleus of trained troops around
which the discontented could rally was necessary;
and the malcontents naturally turned to William,
Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic,
the husband of the King’s daughter Mary. Every
motive of statesmanship, interest, and personal inclination,
combined to induce William to respond to
the appeal. The great object of his life was to
curtail the overshadowing power of Louis XIV.
Without the assistance of England, this was all but
an impossibility. It can hardly be doubted that
William looked forward to his own ultimate election
as King of England. That the men who invited
him had no clear conception of this part of the
political situation seems certain; but William, with
his sagacity and experience, must have been perfectly
aware of the only possible satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>By October, 1688, William had gathered a fleet
of some 500 transports and store-ships, with an
escort of over 50 men-of-war, at Helvoetsluys.
The danger in his path was that of France, and
had James II. been less stupid and less proud at
the wrong moment, there can be no doubt that
William’s plans would have been brought to an
abrupt end by a French invasion. The great
European alliance against France was already
formed, and war was about to break out. The
French armies were already collecting at the
frontier. But James rudely repelled the offers of
his ally and practical overlord, and Louis turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
his arms against Germany. William was therefore
left free to sail.</p>

<p>His expedition cannot be described in any sense
as a hostile invasion. It is mentioned in this work
in order to draw a comparison between the foreign
attacks successfully repelled by England, and this
officially hostile but actually friendly expedition
which landed and did its work, because it was deliberately
allowed to pass unopposed.</p>

<p>The fleet which James possessed was fully equal
to crippling that of William, had it been directed
with energy and fidelity. This was not the case.
The ships had been for the most part reconstructed
by James, and materially the navy was strong.
The commander, Lord Dartmouth, was faithful.
But the majority of the officers were disloyal, and
they persuaded Dartmouth to take up a position
from which it was impossible to work out of the
Thames in time to stop any passing fleet. The
army, though it was three times as strong as that of
William, was rotten to the very core with discontent
and treachery. Those of the superior officers who
were faithful were often the least capable&mdash;notably
the Commander-in-Chief, the Frenchman Louis
Duras, Lord Feversham. The ablest of them all,
General Churchill, was the worst traitor. It was
practically certain that William would meet little
effective resistance from the fleet and army which
were nominally opposed to him.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that England at this time
presented to the world a very depressing spectacle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
That the House of Stuart had proved poor and
faithless guardians of the national honour was undoubted,
and the Whigs, in endeavouring to oust
them, could at least lay claim to political consistency.
But the Church and the Tories were simply obeying
the dictates of self-interest and injured pride.
Open rebellion need not be dishonourable, but very
many members, both of James’s civil and defensive
services, were traitors.</p>

<p>So far as its events are concerned, the story of
the expedition may be told in a few sentences.
William had at first intended to land in the North,
where his adherents&mdash;the Whig Earl of Devonshire,
and the Tory Lord Danby&mdash;were ready to receive
him. He sailed on October 19, but was driven back,
and unable to start again until November 1. The
wind was favourable, and rapidly rose. The vast
fleet went past the mouth of the Thames, and Lord
Dartmouth, owing to the faulty dispositions into
which he had been persuaded, could not come out
in time to oppose it. William passed down the
Channel unmolested, and landed, ‘as every schoolboy
knows,’ at Brixham on November 5. Dartmouth
was following down the Channel, but the wind again
changed, and he put into Portsmouth. Had the
fleets met, the result cannot be doubted. The Dutch
fleet was commanded by the refugee English Admiral
Herbert, and his ships were full of English seamen.
The crews of James’s fleet were thoroughly discontented,
and half the ships would undoubtedly have
been carried over by their captains. To discuss the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
events of 1688 as if they constituted a military campaign
is a mistake. William’s design rested upon
the known fact that England as a whole was not
merely passive, but actively friendly.</p>

<p>William, having landed, occupied Exeter with his
army of 14,000, of whom over 3,000 were British
infantry. For a week there was hesitation, for he had
not been expected, and the memory of the Bloody
Assize hung over the West. But soon the Western
gentry, both Whigs and Tories, began pouring into
Exeter, while all over England revolt blazed up.
The royal officers deserted in a manner that can
only be described as utterly shameless. William
entered London on December 16 without any fighting
on the route, except a skirmish at Wincanton, in
which one of his Scottish battalions roughly handled
Colonel Patrick Sarsfield’s Irish regiment. James
fled to France, and England was lost and won almost
without a blow. Not only this, but Jacobitism was
never again, except in one or two remote localities,
a real militant force. From the military point of
view, one may almost say that everything was prearranged,
and the main lesson to be learnt from the
English Revolution is that, when public opinion is
not dormant and the defensive services are amenable
to its influence, it is impossible for the mere official
administration to maintain itself.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ‘FIFTEEN’ AND THE ‘FORTY-FIVE’</span></h2>

<p>The efforts of the dispossessed Stuart dynasty to
re-establish itself in the British Isles produced the
last land invasions of England by way of Scotland.
That of 1715 was insignificant. It cannot be said
that either had the faintest chance of success unaided.
Still, they were invasions in the true sense of the
word and, as such, merit some notice.</p>

<p>Though the Stuart James II. had been expelled
in 1688, the dynasty continued in a sense to reign
in the female branch until 1702, though with a gap
caused by the death of Queen Mary II. in 1695.
But the male branch was now to all intents a foreign
family with foreign ideas, and it was also Roman
Catholic in its religion. It is unquestionable that
the last Stuarts suffered for the misdeeds of their
ancestors, but no one who studies impartially the
record of the family as kings of Great Britain can
well avoid the conclusion that the men who governed
the country in 1714 were wise not to recall them.</p>

<p>It does not appear that there was any widespread
Jacobite feeling in England. Certainly it assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
no practical form. That there was sympathy with
the exiled family is probable, but it was largely
the product of the chivalrous strain in the English
national character which has so often impelled
Englishmen to side with a losing cause.</p>

<p>In Scotland matters were somewhat different.
There was a great deal of dislike to the Union of
the two countries on the part of narrow Scottish
patriots. At the same time the Presbyterian Lowlanders
were thoroughly opposed to Stuart rule, and
active Jacobite sympathy was practically confined to
a few nobles and their tenants. That section of the
Highlands which was at feud with the Campbells
was the only part even of Scotland which sided with
the exiled dynasty, and in this case self-interest had
more to do with the action of the clans than loyalty.</p>

<p>On September 6, 1715, John Erskine, Earl of
Mar, a shifty politician, nicknamed ‘Bobbing
John’ by his contemporaries, raised the Stuart
banner at Braemar. The ‘Royalist’ clans rose,
and the Hanoverian general, John Campbell, Duke
of Argyll, could only hold the line of the Forth
and await reinforcements from England. The
Hanoverian Government, ably directed by General
Stanhope, was active to nip in the bud any
Jacobite risings, and eventually the revolt broke out
in the farthest corner of England.</p>

<p>It was not until October 6 that Mr. Thomas
Forster, the son of a Cumberland landowner, rose
in arms for the Stuart claimant, and was joined
by Lords Derwentwater and Widdrington. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
hoped to seize Newcastle and its coal-mines, but
they were far too weak; and even when joined by
the few Jacobite sympathizers in south-western
Scotland, under Lords Kenmure, Nithsdale, Wintoun,
and Carnwath, they mustered only 600 horsemen.</p>

<p>To assist this forlorn rising the Earl of Mar
detached from the large force, now assembled at
Perth, some 2,000 Highlanders under General
MacIntosh. Covered by a very feebly executed
feint upon Stirling made by Mar, MacIntosh
crossed the Firth of Forth, cleverly evading the
English cruisers which guarded the passage. He
occupied Leith, and the terror in Edinburgh brought
Argyll with a part of his scanty force back from
Stirling, but in accordance with his orders MacIntosh
passed on southward to join the Border Jacobites.
He found them at Rothbury in Northumberland, and
the united force now amounted to 2,500 men.</p>

<p>From the first the seeds of disaster were present
in the little army. The one commander of any
capacity was MacIntosh; but Forster, by virtue of
a commission from James, was Commander-in-Chief.
He had no military experience, and appears to have
been hopelessly incapable. The Hanoverian commander
in the north, General George Carpenter,
had only four weak regiments of cavalry at his
disposal; but he anticipated the Jacobites at
Dumfries, which was found garrisoned. Thereupon
it was resolved to invade England. Lancashire
was supposed to be strongly Jacobite. Widdrington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
believed that 20,000 Lancashire men would join if
a Jacobite force appeared among them.</p>

THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</div></div>

<p>The resolution at once increased the dissension.
Many Highlanders deserted. Nevertheless the
march began. On November 1 the Border was
crossed. Lord Lonsdale had collected a mass of
totally undisciplined and
half-armed peasantry, some
6,000 strong, at Penrith, to
oppose the invaders; but
they dispersed in terror of
the wild Highlanders, and
the Jacobites pushed on into
Lancashire. The advance
was slow. Desertions were
frequent, and there were
very few recruits. General
Carpenter had been diverted
by news of an attack on
Newcastle, but was returning
on his tracks; and
General Willes was in front
with the Government troops
in Lancashire. Not until
they neared Preston did
they acquire a respectable reinforcement of some
200 well-armed men. But it was noted that they
were all Roman Catholics&mdash;an ominous fact. At
Preston itself a number of ill-armed men appear to
have joined. By this time the Jacobites were also
possessed of six or seven guns. It was decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
halt at Preston for a few days to rally the expected
Lancashire recruits, but on the 12th, before there
had been time to erect proper defences, the
Government troops attacked them.</p>

<p>General Willes had collected six regiments of
cavalry and a battalion of infantry&mdash;all very weak&mdash;perhaps
1,800 men in all. The Jacobites were
certainly as numerous, and occupied a town which
was easily defensible, and might have been made
very strong. The bridge over the Ribble to the
south of Preston was guarded by 300 men. At
each of the four main entrances to the town barricades
were in course of construction, and three
were armed each with two guns. But the lack of
resolute or skilful leading was apparent. The
garrison at the bridge evacuated its post almost
without resistance&mdash;at Forster’s own order, so it
was said. The Highlanders, however, fought gallantly,
and repulsed several attacks made by
dismounted cavalry. At nightfall the place was
untaken; but early on the 13th Carpenter arrived
on the north side of the town, and Forster tamely
surrendered. He was indeed utterly unfit for his
post. When accused of treachery by his associates
he shed tears, and faltered out feeble excuses. But
it cannot be said that he was much worse than the
lords. Surely men of spirit and energy would have
repudiated the cowardly surrender. Yet nothing
was done. Even the Highlanders appear to
have had enough of campaigning; probably
they were too home-sick to care to fight when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
there was a chance of returning to their beloved
hills.</p>

<p>The actual number of prisoners taken was 1,496,
including six peers. The Government was guilty
of outraging the most distinguished of the captives
by parading them bound on horseback through the
streets of London, but there was little bloodshed.
The leaders, according to the ideas of the day, could
hardly hope for mercy; but, as a matter of fact, only
Lords Kenmure and Derwentwater suffered death.
Lady Nithsdale heroically contrived her husband’s
rescue from the Tower, and Forster and MacIntosh
also escaped, Forster by the aid of his sister Dorothy.
Certainly in this affair the female Jacobites showed
to better advantage than their men. Of the other
prisoners, 26 were executed, and some hundreds
transported&mdash;a contrast to the awful butchery which
had followed Sedgemoor only thirty years before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Jacobite rising in Scotland had
come to an ignominious end. Though the claimant
himself had appeared among his followers, the
army, demoralized by dissension and poor leading,
was melting fast away, and James soon left for the
Continent. He was himself apparently the most
estimable of the Stuarts&mdash;brave, regular in his life,
and not devoid of ability, but he was not a man to
inspire devotion. His son, Charles Edward, was of
a different type, and, besides considerable capacity,
possessed all the fascination of his ancestress, Mary.
The influence which the memory of ‘Bonnie Prince
Charlie’ exercised over the susceptible Highlanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
is remarkable, and is, indeed, hardly extinct at the
present day. In 1745 England was at war with
France in the cause of the Empress Maria Theresia,
and was faring badly. Prince Charles saw his chance.
His father had no confidence of success, and his son’s
action was taken against his wish; but the Prince
raised a small sum of money, and with this and a
slender supply of arms and ammunition landed on
the west coast of Scotland in August, 1745.</p>

<p>The story of the brilliant campaign that followed
lies without the bounds of this book. The success
of the Highlanders was rapid and complete. Yet,
in the midst of victory, the shadow of disaster lay
upon the Jacobites.</p>

<p>It was but too obvious that nearly half the Highlands
were hostile, and that clans which had once
been Jacobite now held aloof. Charles’s noblest
supporter, the chivalrous Cameron of Lochiel, had
little hope of victory. There were differences
in the Prince’s suite. His best, perhaps it should
be said his only, general, Lord George Murray,
was at variance with the Franco-Scottish nobles
and gentlemen of the Prince’s entourage. Money
and supplies were scanty, and not easily collected.
Assistance was promised by France, but, such as
it was, it was difficult to send it in face of the
English fleet, and, even so, it probably did harm
by giving a dynastic war the appearance of a
foreign invasion. In England and the Scottish
Lowlands a prosperous peace of thirty years had
almost obliterated the memory of the Stuarts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
in neither country had educated men any reason to
look back upon it with pride. The Hanoverians
were not popular, but Jacobitism was already
tending to recede into the region of dreams.</p>

<p>By the end of October Prince Charles had
collected near Edinburgh some 7,000 men. They
were nearly all Highland infantry; there were
only four weak squadrons of cavalry and thirteen
small field pieces, with very few trained gunners.
Against this small force the English Government
had in the field three armies, each some 10,000
strong. The first lay at Newcastle under the now
aged and worn-out Marshal Wade, the constructor
of the famous military roads of the Highlands.
The second was in Staffordshire. It was commanded
in succession by General Ligonier and
the young Duke of Cumberland. The third force&mdash;royal
guards, and London militia and volunteers&mdash;was
at Finchley, under the personal command of
George II., now advanced in years. London itself
formed several volunteer corps, one composed
entirely of lawyers and law-students. The military
value of these corps does not affect the issue&mdash;the
point is, that public sentiment was strongly
anti-Jacobite. The Prince’s enterprise, in fact, was
regarded as a foreign invasion.</p>

<p>Prince Charles and his advisers had resolved to
enter England by way of Carlisle, thus avoiding
Wade, who lay about Newcastle. On November 16
the Jacobite army reached Carlisle, which was practically
defenceless, and on the next day it surrendered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
A small garrison was left there, and the advance
continued. The forlornness of the enterprise is
to be gauged from the fact that already the Highlanders
were deserting by hundreds. When, on the
28th, Charles entered Manchester, he probably had
not more than 5,000 foot and 250 horse. Manchester
welcomed him with an illumination, but the material
results of the march through Lancashire were only
200 recruits and £2,000 in cash. The only favourable
circumstances were that Wade was far in the
rear, and that Cumberland, anxious that Charles
should not enter Wales, where Jacobitism still retained
some vitality, was moving north-westward
by Stone, thus leaving the main road to London
uncovered. Charles broke up from Manchester,
slipped over the Peak, and came down the dales
to Derby, which he entered on December 4.
Cumberland was already falling back towards
Coventry to regain the main road, but Charles had
fairly outmanœuvred him. He was rather less than
130 miles from London by road, and might perhaps
have covered the distance in a week had he continued
his advance. But the heart was beaten out
of his staff, and they would go no farther. They
saw the hopelessly meagre results of the daring
march, and they insisted upon a retreat. There
were reinforcements awaiting them in Scotland
which would double their strength; substantial aid
might be obtained from France, and the line of the
Forth defended against the Hanoverians. As is
well known, even this modest programme could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
be carried out. Indeed, Edinburgh and most of the
Lowlands had returned to their allegiance as soon
as the Jacobite army marched southward. The
hostility of Scotland, except the Central Highlands,
to the Stuart cause was apparent.</p>

<p class="subcap"><i>From a miniature presented by the Prince to Lochiel.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Would Charles have succeeded had he pressed
on? It is more than doubtful. The fact that there
was considerable panic in London on December 6,
and a run upon the Bank of England, proves
nothing. Englishmen have a most remarkable
capacity for such panics, and also for seeing their
enemies double on every possible occasion. King
George had at Finchley some 4,000 highly trained
and mainly veteran troops, a powerful artillery, and
at least 5,000 militia and volunteers, who were
hardly likely to be entirely useless, especially in
street fighting. They show a somewhat robust
faith who believe that Charles’s 5,000 men or less,
almost destitute of cavalry and artillery, would have
gained the day, and have been able to capture
London before the arrival of Cumberland. From
the military point of view, Murray and the staff
were perfectly right in advising retreat. Politically,
perhaps Charles was correct in his contention that
he must push on, but it was a gambler’s chance. If
one thing is more certain than another, it is that
Jacobitism, everywhere in Great Britain except part
of Scotland, was already moribund.</p>

<p>The Jacobite army evacuated Derby on the
night of December 6. Its retreat was disorderly.
The hopes which had buoyed up the chiefs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
dying away, and they had to face a gloomy prospect
of overthrow and ruin. The men, too, could
not fail to see the depression of their leaders, and
drifted out of hand. Straggling and pillage became
general. The villagers began to cut off those
who strayed from the line of march. The people
of Manchester, friendly on the advance, now broke
into rioting, and were mulcted in a fine of £5,000.
At Wigan an attempt was made to shoot the
Prince. He was disheartened and depressed, and
made little attempt to restrain his men, who streamed
along the road with scarcely any discipline. Only
the rearguard under Murray still closed the march
in good order, and brought along with it the
artillery and baggage which would otherwise have
been abandoned.</p>

<p>Cumberland was near Coventry when he heard
of Charles’s retreat. He at once began to pursue
with his cavalry, while the country gentry supplied
1,000 horses to mount part of his infantry. He
hurried northward through Cheshire and Lancashire,
but the Highlanders had a long start, and
were well in advance. At Preston General Oglethorpe
joined with some of Wade’s cavalry. That
weak old commander was still drifting ‘in the air,’
and Cumberland acted wisely in superseding him,
though his own choice, Sir John Hawley, was
hardly a success. On December 18 Charles was
at Penrith, while Murray with the rearguard was
strongly posted in enclosures at Clifton, two miles
to the south. Here he was overtaken by Cumberland’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
mounted infantry, and a brisk skirmish
ensued. The fire of the infantry made little impression
upon the well-posted Highlanders, and Murray,
making a fine charge with the MacPhersons, drove
them back with the loss of 100 men. By the
morning Cumberland had his whole mounted force
in hand, but Murray had already retired, and on
the 20th joined the Prince at Carlisle. There the
English sympathizers were left as a garrison, to
surrender, as was inevitable, a few days later.
Charles crossed the Border on the 20th, and continued
his march to Glasgow, which he reoccupied
on the 26th.</p>

<p>So ended the bold adventure. The small Jacobite
army, partly by good fortune, partly by skilful
strategy, had penetrated to within a week’s march
of London, and had returned to its advanced base
in safety indeed, but without success, and with
scarce an English recruit to swell its ranks.
General Hawley’s stupidity was to give it one
more victory, and then Jacobitism as a political
factor was to be trampled out of existence on the
bleak moor of Culloden.</p>

<p>Aristophanes, in ‘The Acharnians,’ puts into the
mouth of Dicæopolis some sarcastic observations
as to what the Athenians would do if the Spartans
manned a skiff and stole a pug-puppy from one of
the islands. The poet’s imagined invasion of the
Athenian Empire is very much on a par with the
two French landings which have taken place in
England since the year 1689.</p>

<p>The Revolution left England under the rule of a
monarch of her own choosing, but torn with faction,
and committed of necessity to a war with France.
At this time the French Navy was more powerful
than it has ever been; but it was hampered by the
inexperience and timidity of its officers, and did far
less than might otherwise have been accomplished.
On June 30 the famous French Admiral, Anne
Hilarion de Cotentin, Comte de Tourville, gained a
complete victory over the allied English and Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
under Herbert, now Earl of Torrington, off Beachy
Head, and for some weeks was master of the
Channel. On July 27 he put into Torbay, while
the galleys which accompanied the heavy ships
rowed a few miles northwards, and landed about a
thousand men, who burned the fishing village of
Teignmouth. The inhabitants escaped. Some
fishing-boats were also burned, but after remaining
on shore for awhile the landing party re-embarked.
Tourville had with him several galleys fit for inshore
work, but this insignificant operation was all that
Louis XIV.’s seamen were capable of effecting after
a great victory. Its effect was to rouse the somewhat
dormant national spirit. The militia of Devon
assembled with enthusiasm and marched down to
the coast, burning with desire to meet the invaders.</p>

<p>For over a century no French force landed on the
shores of England, though they were successful in
effecting various landings in Ireland, chiefly during
the early years of William III. The centre of
British naval defence was always the mouth of the
Channel, and it was comparatively easy to slip past
the defending fleets to Ireland. It was this design
which the great French general Hoche took up in
1796, and which brought about the last landing of
French troops in England.</p>

<p>Lazare Hoche was, perhaps, the greatest of the
warriors produced by the Revolution, with the
exception of Napoleon. He had made his mark by
a victorious defence of the eastern frontier against
the Austrians in 1793, being then only twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
years of age. His next service&mdash;the greatest that
he ever rendered to his country&mdash;was to end the
terrible civil war in the west. It was in the course
of this that he came into communication with the
Irish leaders who were busily engaged in rousing their
countrymen to rise against the harsh English rule.</p>

<p>Hoche’s sympathies were naturally with the Irish,
and his hatred of England, as evidenced by his
letters, amounted to passionate folly. La Vendée
was at last tranquil, and Hoche proposed to employ
part of his great army of 100,000 men in an invasion
of Ireland. On December 16 a fleet of
seventeen battleships, twenty frigates and brigs,
and seven transports, under Vice-Admiral Morard
de Galles, sailed from Brest with Hoche and some
16,000 troops. The expedition was a failure, though
not owing to active British naval operations. Hoche
and the Admiral lost touch with their fleet. Ships
were wrecked, and the armament was scattered, but
Rear-Admiral Bouvet actually reached Bantry Bay
with a number of ships and 7,000 troops. But the
weather was bad, and though urged to disembark
the soldiers by General Grouchy, the senior military
officer, he eventually put back to Brest. Hoche
arrived in Bantry Bay to find his fleet already gone,
and could only follow it. Had he actually landed,
even with only 7,000 men, in smouldering Ireland,
there is no predicting where his victorious career
would have ended. The Protestant militia of Ireland
were utterly worthless against the fine French
troops, as was proved a year later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
One of Hoche’s subordinate designs in this great
expedition was to land subsidiary and distracting
detachments in England itself. Unhappily for his
fame, he allowed himself to be led by his bitter
hatred of England into very discreditable methods.
He proposed to form columns of military delinquents
and released convicts which should lay waste and
terrorize the enemy’s country. Such a scheme had
been devised by the Committee of Public Safety;
but it is a blot upon the fair fame both of Carnot,
over whose signature the plan appears, and of
Hoche.</p>

<p>Two regiments were eventually formed out of
these disreputable elements. They were called the
1st and 2nd Legions of Franks; but the criminal
regiment was called, if not named, the ‘Black
Legion.’ The whole design was distinctly foolish,
despite its specious air of cunning. The men of
whom the legions were composed were scarcely
likely to risk hardships and death for the sake of
the Government that had imprisoned them, and it
is tolerably clear that their capacity for mischief
must have been greatly lessened by their ignorance
of the English language. Open brigandage they
might commit, but it could only be in large bodies
which could easily be hunted down. In fact, if
there were not evidence to the contrary, one might
conclude that the French Government only wished
to be rid of these criminal elements.</p>

<p>On February 22, 1797, three frigates and a lugger,
under Commodore Castagnier, appeared near Fishguard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Bay in Pembrokeshire, and landed some 1,400
of ‘the legions.’ The Commander was an Irish-American
adventurer named Tate. The intention
had been to put them ashore in Somerset in order
to burn Bristol. The actual landing was made at
Llanwnda, about two miles from Goodwick, in
an inlet called Careg Gwasted Bay. One life
was lost, but otherwise by the 23rd the force was
landed in safety, with its ammunition, and bivouacked
on the heights above the inlet.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>A HIGHLAND OUTPOST.</p>

<p class="subcap"><i>From the picture by John Pettie, R.A.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Now, however, the weak point in the nefarious
design showed itself. Owing to a recent wreck
there were great quantities of wine and spirits
available in the surrounding cottages. The men,
devoid of any sense of duty or discipline, and only
too ready to forget the misery of their life in prison,
seized upon liquor with avidity, and before long
General Tate’s force was either helplessly intoxicated
or completely out of hand, engaged in reckless
pillage. Castagnier, having accomplished the landing,
set sail and stood out to sea. It certainly
seems as if he had had orders to abandon the
‘legionaries’ to their fate. No attempt could be
made to capture Fishguard itself, and Tate and his
staff seem to have been powerless among their
ruffianly followers. There is evidence that they
endeavoured to suppress the excesses that were
going on around them, but the men refused to
obey orders. Brutal violence there was none;
the invaders only seized all the food that they
could find. Tate even endeavoured to return his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
property to a bold Welshman who remonstrated
with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men of the countryside were
assembling <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>. Near Fishguard there were
but 300 militiamen, seamen, and gunners, but
before evening on the 23rd they were joined by
Lord Cawdor with 60 yeomanry and 320 of the
Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire Militia. By this
time there were collected on Goodwick Sands,
headed by all the gentry of the neighbourhood who
had been able to join, 2,000 furious Welshmen,
armed with every sort of weapon&mdash;scythes, hayforks,
picks, mattocks, and reaping-hooks&mdash;everything, in
short, that had an edge or a point. Of properly
armed men, including the militia, there were probably
less than 1,000. There was a lack of ammunition,
and lead from the roof of St. David’s Cathedral
was used for moulding bullets. The women
of the counties streamed after their men, and
it is quite likely that, as has been said, their high
black hats and red cloaks were mistaken by the
befuddled ‘legionaries’ for regular uniforms. Tate
saw the seemingly formidable force collecting in
his front; he knew that his own men were helpless,
and would in any case probably refuse to fight.
He sent a letter to Cawdor offering to surrender
on terms. Cawdor replied that, in view of his own
great and increasing superiority of strength, he could
only insist upon unconditional surrender! So next day
the episode ended. The number of prisoners is given
as ‘near 1,400.’ A light is thrown upon the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
intentions of the French Government by what subsequently
happened. They refused to exchange
the prisoners. The British Government thereupon
threatened to land them in Brittany to do their
worst. This brought the Directory to their senses,
and the exchange was effected. France received
back her criminals; Britain regained an equal
number of good fighting men, and thus, in circumstances
not far removed from the proceedings of
comic opera, ended the famous episode of Fishguard.</p>

<p>The fact that Hoche’s large expedition did
actually, in part at least, reach the shores of Ireland
was due largely to the slackness of Lord Bridport,
the commander of the Channel Squadron. The
British admirals had not yet adopted the plan of
close and relentless blockade, which was soon afterwards
initiated by Jarvis. The French were further
assisted by the violent gales which, while they
scattered their own fleet, also forced the British
to run to port for shelter. The Fishguard raid, like
that of General Humbert in Ireland shortly afterwards,
is of value as demonstrating the impossibility,
even to a great naval power, of preventing the
landing of small invading forces. A close blockade
might, in the days of sailing ships, be broken by
exceptionally bad weather; but since the introduction
of steam, blockades are more effective, and
naval movements generally are carried out with
infinitely greater precision.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NAPOLEONIC DESIGN</span>

<span class="subhead">1804</span></h2>

<p>No work dealing with the invasions of England
would be complete without some notice of the
attempts, or supposed attempts, of Napoleon to
invade this island. To discuss them in detail here
is unnecessary, especially in view of the fact that
more than one excellent work has been produced on
the subject in recent years. In any case Napoleon
did not approach success so nearly as Philip II. of
Spain, since he never brought his fleet to the vital
point. He was never able, even in the height of
his power, to land a single company on the shores
of England. Taking this into consideration, it is
only proposed here to very briefly discuss the extent
and scope of Napoleon’s preparations, and to give a
summary of expert opinion upon them.</p>

<p>The naval position in 1804, when France and
Spain were united against Britain, was as follows:
The British Navy was nearly twice as strong in numbers
as those of the allies together, and enormously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
superior in quality. The allied force was, furthermore,
scattered in fragments in a dozen ports from
Toulon to the Texel, and closely blockaded by
superior British squadrons. Here and there, by
taking advantage of favourable circumstances,
French squadrons did escape from their harbours;
but a general concentration in the face of the British
fleet was always impossible, and without the command
of the sea invasion was hopeless.</p>

<p>Napoleon, it must be remembered, was regardless
of veracity, and, except when his statements are
confirmed by independent testimony, they can rarely
be accepted. His bulletins are masterpieces of
mendacity, and his correspondence, though much
of it was suppressed by admiring editors, shows how
prone he was to paint rose-coloured pictures for the
benefit of his subjects, if not to deceive himself.
Moreover, as is well known, he was so surrounded
by treachery that he often literally dared not speak
his inmost thoughts, and coined fables for the
misleading of his betrayers.</p>

<p>Finally, there is one fact that cannot be overlooked.
Napoleon was no seaman. He was a
great soldier&mdash;in his prime probably the greatest of
modern times&mdash;but in naval matters he was an
amateur. His admirals knew it only too well. His
able Minister of Marine, Decrès, was always warning
him that the concentration and manœuvring of
sailing squadrons was a very different operation to
that of the massing of troops on land. Others said
the same. No doubt the timidity which has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
characterized the French at sea had much to do
with their caution and nervousness. But they were
certainly right in the main. The French Navy was
bad in quality; the Spanish Navy worse. Both
together were inferior in numbers to that of Britain,
and in quality there was no comparison. Numbers
alone are no test of efficiency, and had Napoleon
succeeded in concentrating 60 French and Spanish
battleships in the Channel, the fleet would have
been unable to meet with success a British force
of 40, even discounting the great strength of the
latter in three-decked vessels.<a name="FNanchor_L" id="FNanchor_L" href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">L</a> Mr. Julian Corbett,
who has discussed the question exhaustively in
‘The Campaign of Trafalgar,’ is of opinion (1) that
Napoleon was only saved from disaster up to
Trafalgar by the crafty French admirals whom he
despised so much; (2) that had the Franco-Spanish
fleet really appeared in the Channel, the
result would have been its utter destruction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_L" id="Footnote_L" href="#FNanchor_L" class="fnanchor">L</a> A three-decker was reckoned by tacticians as equal to two
two-deckers.</p></div>

<p>Colonel Desbrière, who has discussed the problem
from the French side, and has collected almost all
the evidence available, sums up Napoleon’s plans
for gaining the command of the Channel in a
scathing paragraph:</p>

<p>‘Two escapes from ports blockaded by a superior
force; two blockades to be broken at Cadiz and
Ferrol; a junction at Martinique, already indicated
to the English by the despatch of Missiessy&mdash;such
was the programme, if we confine ourselves to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
letter of the instructions. It is useless for historians
to admire it.’ And when Desbrière examines it
further in order to find the Napoleonic touch, he
practically comes to the conclusion that the Emperor
was ready to stake all on a mere gambler’s throw
with all the chances against him. If he won, it was
well. If he lost, he sacrificed only his weak and
inefficient navy. In fact, whether he won or lost,
his reputation was safe; and how nervously tender
he was of his untarnished renown it is easy to see
in the multitudinous letters in which he tries to
explain away his failures.</p>

<p>So much for the naval situation. Considering
next the army of invasion and its means of
transport, the position was briefly as follows:</p>

<p>There were in the harbours of Boulogne, Etaples,
Wimereux, and Ambleteuse, some 2,000 flat-bottomed
craft of all kinds, mostly armed with guns, and
capable of carrying 131,000 men and 6,000 horses.
In appearance the armament was a formidable one.
But, in the first place, the vessels themselves, armed
though they were, could not move without an overwhelming
naval escort. Hastily built, useless in
rough water, almost entirely without trained crews,
one British ‘seventy-four’ was a match for scores
of them. This Napoleon knew as well as anyone,
and though sections of the great flotilla crept at
times along the coast from harbour to harbour, they
never ventured a couple of miles from land. The
vast swarm of vessels was more than the harbours
could contain. Enormous sums were spent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
clearing and deepening them; but as fast as they
were cleared they silted up again, and the task had
to be begun anew. So packed were the harbours
that not half the vessels could be floated out on one
tide, even if the troops could have been embarked
in time to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>This, however, might have been expected. It is
true that very different and highly-coloured accounts
were spread abroad in Great Britain, and produced
that extraordinary combination of panic and preparation
which seems to be the normal condition of the
British people in the face of a remote possibility of
invasion. But the strangest circumstance to all who
have been accustomed to believe in Napoleon’s
overwhelming military superiority, is that while his
transport was sufficient for 130,000 men, he had
only 90,000, with less than 3,000 horses within
reach at the critical moment. More than half his
cavalry were without horses. Had he landed in
England he would have been opposed by a regular
force almost as large as his own, with 12,000
excellent cavalry against his 3,000, besides the local
forces, some 400,000 strong. Many of these volunteers
had been in training for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Such, in short, is a summary of the situation
which caused the British public so much uneasiness,
if not fright. One can but observe once more that
a tendency to panic before an undefined danger
seems inherent in the English national character.
Had Napoleon landed, his chances of success were
remote. In quality the British Regular Army was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
least as good as the Grande Armée. The Egyptian
campaign of 1801 had proved it; the victory of
Maida was soon to drive the lesson home. Whatever
disaster our generals might expose themselves
to, their men might fairly be trusted to pull them
out of it. Wellington, later, calmly counted upon
this as a factor in warfare. On the whole, it is
probable that Napoleon’s career would have ended
in 1805 instead of 1815, and in Kent or Sussex
instead of at Waterloo. But the chances of his
landing were of the faintest, and the British
admirals knew it very well. It is customary to
believe that Napoleon deceived them. In reality,
as Mr. Julian Corbett grimly remarks, they were
playing the strategic game in assured mastery high
over his head.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SITE OF THE BATTLE OF ACLEA</span></h2>

<p>Aclea was formerly generally supposed to be Ockley
in Surrey, near Horsham, but Mr. C. Cooksey
(Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club) gives
good reasons for believing it to be Church Oakley,
near Basingstoke, close to the London-Winchester
road. The Northmen had just sacked London, and
one hardly sees why they should plunge into the
Andredsweald when the capital of Wessex offered a
fair prospect of booty. In Domesday Book also
Oakley is called Aclei while Ockley is Hoclie. It
is not true, as Professor Oman says, that Ockley is
far from any road; it is, of course, on the Roman
road (Stane Street) to Regnum (Chichester); but it
is certainly a somewhat unaccountable place in which
to find the Viking horde. Oakley is, at any rate,
almost on the direct route from London to Winchester,
and is decidedly the more probable site of
the two.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ENGLISH AND SPANISH FLEETS IN 1588</span></h2>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the numbers of the fleets at
any definite date. The lists collected by Captain
Fernandez Duro in his work ‘La Armada Invencible’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
differ widely. The tables of the Spanish
fleet are based upon a careful study and comparison of
these lists, especially Nos. 145, 150, and 180. It is
worthy of note that the approximate total arrived at
is that given by Admiral Pedro de Valdes to Drake
as the strength of the Armada.</p>

<p>As regards tonnage, that of the English ships is,
with few exceptions, calculated on the contemporary
Burden Rule (length of keel, multiplied by the beam
and the draft of water, and the product divided by
100), with 25 per cent. added. The amount added
for ‘ton and tonnage’ varied from 25 to 33-1/3 per
cent.</p>

<p>The tonnage of the Spanish ships is taken from
the official figures. Mr. Julian Corbett thinks that
the Spanish system of measurement gave results
much higher than those of the English, but after
studying and applying the English and Spanish
rules to the same ship-dimensions, the authors have
come to the conclusion that the discrepancy in this
respect was non-existent. The <i class="shipname">Revenge</i> by English
measurement was 441 tons burden; by Spanish
rules, apparently, 430. The main deduction, therefore,
to be made from the Spanish figures is in
respect of the difference between the Seville <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">tonelada</i>
(53·44 cubic feet) and the English ton (60 cubic
feet). But even here it cannot be said that this can
be applied to any but the Andalucian ships. On
the whole, if a fair comparison be needed, perhaps
about 10 per cent. should be deducted from the
official Spanish figures; but nothing definite can
be said.</p>
